"Baby One More Time"

Oh, baby, baby
Oh, baby, baby

Oh, baby, baby
How was I supposed to know
That something wasn't right here?
Oh, baby, baby
I shouldn't have let you go
And now you're out of sight, yeah

Show me how you want it to be
Tell me, baby,
'Cause I need to know now, oh, because...

[Chorus:]
My loneliness is killing me (and I)
I must confess, I still believe (still believe)
When I'm not with you I lose my mind
Give me a sign
Hit me, baby, one more time

Oh, baby, baby
The reason I breathe is you
Boy, you got me blinded
Oh, baby, baby
There's nothing that I wouldn't do
It's not the way I planned it

Show me how you want it to be
Tell me, baby,
'Cause I need to know now, oh, because...

[Chorus]

Oh, baby, baby
Oh, baby, baby
Ah, yeah, yeah

Oh, baby, baby
How was I supposed to know?
Oh, pretty, baby
I shouldn't have let you go

I must confess
That my loneliness
Is killing me now
Don't you know I still believe
That you will be here
And give me a sign
Hit me, baby, one more time

[Chorus]

I must confess that my loneliness
Is killing me now
Don't you know I still believe
That you will be here
And give me a sign
Hit me, baby, one more time




"(You Drive Me) Crazy"

Baby, I'm so into you
You got that somethin'. What can I do?
Baby, you spin me around
The earth is movin' but I can't feel the ground

Every time you look at me
My heart is jumpin', it's easy to see

Lovin' you means so much more
More than anything I ever felt before

[Chorus:]
You drive me crazy
I just can't sleep
I'm so excited, I'm in too deep
Oh... crazy,
But it feels alright
Baby, thinkin' of you keeps me up all night

Tell me, you're so into me
That I'm the only one you will see
Tell me, I'm not in the blue,
That I'm not wastin' my feelings on you

Lovin' you means so much more.
More than anything I ever felt before

[Chorus]

Crazy,
I just can't sleep
I'm so excited, I'm in too deep
Crazy,
But it feels alright
Every day and every night

You drive me crazy (you drive me crazy, baby)
I'm so excited, I'm in too deep
Oh... crazy,
(you make me feel alright)
Baby, thinkin' of you keeps me up all night

You drive me crazy (you drive me crazy, baby)
Oh... crazy (you make me feel alright)
But it feels alright
Baby, thinkin' of you keeps me up all night
Baby, thinkin' of you keeps me up all night



"Sometimes"

You tell me you're in love with me
Like you can't take your pretty eyes away from me
It's not that I don't want to stay
But every time you come too close I move away

I wanna believe in everything that you say
'Cause it sounds so good
But if you really want me move slow
There's things about me you just have to know

Sometimes I run
Sometimes I hide
Sometimes I'm scared of you
But all I really want is to hold you tight
Treat you right, be with you day and night
Baby, all I need is time

I don't wanna be so shy
Every time that I'm alone I wonder why
Hope that you will wait for me
You'll see that you're the only one for me

I wanna believe in everything that you say
'Cause it sounds so good
But if you really want me move slow
There's things about me you just have to know

Sometimes I run (sometimes)
Sometimes I hide
Sometimes I'm scared of you
But all I really want is to hold you tight
Treat you right, be with you day and night
All I really want is to hold you tight
Treat you right, be with you day and night
Baby all I need is time

Just hang around and you'll see
There's nowhere I'd rather be
If you love me, trust in me
The way that I trust in you

Sometimes I run (sometimes)
Sometimes I hide,
Sometimes I'm scared of you (oh)
But all I really want is to hold you tight (hold you tight)
Treat you right, be with you day and night (day and night)

Sometimes I run (sometimes)
Sometimes I hide
Sometimes I'm scared of you
But all I really want is to hold you tight
Treat you right, be with you day and night (day and night)

All I really want is to hold you tight
Be with you day and night

Sometimes I run (sometimes)
Sometimes I hide
Sometimes I'm scared of you
But all I really want is to hold you tight

"Born To Make You Happy"

[Intro:]
Oh, my love [laugh]
Oh, yeah yeah
Oh, yeah 

[Verse 1:]
I'm sitting here alone up in my room
I'm thinking about the times that we've been through 
Oh, my love
I'm looking at a picture in my hand
Trying my best to understand
I really want to know what we did wrong 
With a love that felt so strong
If only you were here tonight 
I know that we could make it right 

[Chorus:]
I don't know how to live without your love
I was born to make you happy
'Cause you're the only one up in my heart
I was born to make you happy
Always and forever, you and me
That's the way our life should be
I don't know how to live without your love
I was born to make you happy

[Verse 2:]
I know I've been a fool since you've been gone
I'd better give it up and carry on 
Oh, my love
'Cause living in a dream of you and me 
Is not the way my life should be
I don't want to cry a tear for you 
So forgive me if I do (ooh)
If only you were here tonight 
I know that we could make it right

[Chorus:]
I don't know how to live without your love
I was born to make you happy
'Cause you're the only one up in my heart
I was born to make you happy
Always and forever, you and me
That's the way our life should be
I don't know how to live without your love
I was born to make you happy

[Hook:]
(Oh yeah)
(Oh yeah)
I'd do anything 
I'd give you my world
I'd wait forever to be your girl
(Just call out my name)
Just call out my name (and I will be there) and I will be there (ooh)
Just to show you how much I care (alright) (ooh)
I was born to make you happy, yeah (ooh) (oh yeah)

[Chorus:] 
I don't know how to live without your love
I was born to make you happy
'Cause you're the only one up in my heart
I was born to make you happy

"From The Bottom Of My Broken Heart"

"Never look back," we said
How was I to know I'd miss you so?
Loneliness up ahead, emptiness behind
Where do I go?

And you didn't hear
All my joy through my tears
All my hopes through my fears
Did you know, still I miss you somehow

[CHORUS:]
From the bottom of my broken heart
There's just a thing or two I'd like you to know
You were my first love, you were my true love
From the first kisses to the very last rose
From the bottom of my broken heart
Even though time may find me somebody new
You were my real love, I never knew love
'Til there was you
From the bottom of my broken heart

"Baby," I said, "please stay.
Give our love a chance for one more day"
We could have worked things out
Taking time is what love's all about

But you put a dart
Through my dreams through my heart
And I'm back where I started again
Never thought it would end

[Repeat CHORUS]

You promised yourself
But to somebody else
And you made it so perfectly clear
Still I wish you were here

[Repeat CHORUS]

"Never look back," we said
How was I to know I'd miss you so?





"I Will Be There"

Oh yeah

You don't have to say what's on your mind
'Cause I know where you've been
Give it up and leave it all behind
And then let me begin

Come on over here
Let me show how things should be
I will make it alright
Let me make it clear
You can put your trust in me
Yes I will be there

[CHORUS:]
When you need someone
You just turn around
And I, will be there
When you're feeling low
Baby let me know
And I, will be there

Won't you let me make it up to you
Now you know where I am
There ain't nothin that I wouldn't do
Just to love once again

Come on over here
Let me show how things should be
I will make it alright
Let me make it clear
You can put your trust in me
Yes I will be there

[Repeat CHORUS]

I will be there
Just take a stand
I'll be here for you
Now and forever
Give one more chance
To show you how much I care
I'll be there

When you need someone
I just turn around
And I will be there
When you're in sorrow
Just let me know and I will be there

[Repeat CHORUS]

"I'll Never Stop Loving You"

But I don’t believe that’s true
Cause the way that I feel
When we are together
I know that’s the way, I always feel for you 

[CHORUS:]
From now until forever thats how long I’ll be true
I will make you this vow and promise you now until forever

And stars will fall from the sky
But this feeling will last
When the suns start burning
But all I wanna do is love you
Until the end of time

To give you all the love (all the love)
Feels for you tonight

our autumn goodbye, autumn goodbye
autumn goodbye 

Thinkin' of you and the love of our lives
in the sweet summertime
so sad but true (so true, so true)
we must leave it behind
in our hearts, in our minds

From April through September
bittersweet was the love that we share
don't forget
I remember

[Repeat CHORUS (2 times)]

Memories can fade

on the time that we borrowed

[Repeat CHORUS (2 times)]

From April through September
bittersweet was the love that we share
don't forget

Walking through time looking for an answer
How can it be this way
What have I done
I just can't help but wonder
How everything could change.

'Cause you've turned my world around
Since you came along, no
After this love was found it seems like we can't go wrong.

[Chorus-2:]
Deep in my heart
I know there's only you
And right from the start I always knew
I never let go
'Cause love you so
Ohhoohh I want you for the rest of my life.

To find a love like this
And here we are
With everything we wished for
I never felt such bliss.

[Repeat Chorus 1+2]

There comes a chance in everyones life
And I beleive it won't happen twice
Now since I've felt the glory of love
I want spend forever
(And ever with you).

Deep in my heart
I want you for the rest of my life
I want you for the rest of my life.

Oh baby, baby

[CHORUS:]
Oops!...I did it again
I played with your heart, got lost in the game
Oh baby, baby

Stronger than yesterday
Now it’s nothing but my way
My lonliness ain’t killing me no more

"Don't Go Knocking On My Door"

Don't go knock on my door
Don't go knock on my door 

Time is up
No more cheat n' lie
No more tears to dry

Finally
I am over you
Totally unblue
And I can hear myself saying
I am better off without you
Stronger than ever and I
I'm tellin' you now

[CHORUS:]

[Repeat CHORUS]





"Satisfaction"

I can't get no satisfaction
I can't get no satisfaction
And I try, and I try, and I try, and I try
I can't get no, I can't get no satisfaction 

When I'm drivin' in my car
And that man comes on the radio
And he's tellin' me more and more
About some useless information
Supposed to fire my imagination
I can't get no, oh no no no
Hey hey hey, this what I say

[CHORUS:]
I can't get no satisfaction
I can't get no reaction
And I try, and I try, and I try, and I try
I can't get no, I can't get no satisfaction

When I'm watchin' my TV
and that girl comes on to tell me
how tight my skirts should be
well she can't tell me who to be
cause I've got my own identity.
I can't get no, oh no no no

I can't get no satisfaction
I can't get no satisfaction

[Repeat CHORUS]

I can't get no, satisfaction
I can't get no, satisfaction

I can't get no satisfaction baby





"Don't Let Me Be The Last To Know"

My friends say you're so into me
And that you need me desperately

But I need to hear it straight from you
If you want me to believe it's true
I've been waiting for so long it hurts
I wanna hear you say the words, please

[CHORUS:]
Don't, don't let me be the last to know
Don't hold back, just let it go
I need to hear you say
You need me all the way
Oh, if you love me so

Yeah, I feel it in the way you touch
But til' you say the words it's not enough

I need to hear you say
You need me all the way
So…baby, if you love me
Don't let me be the last to know





"What U See (Is What You Get)"

You used to say that I was special
Everything was right
But now you think I'm wearing too much make-up
That my dress is too tight
You got no reasons to be jealous
I've never been untrue
So does it really matter if they're looking
I'm only looking at you
You should never try to change me
I can be nobody else
And I like the way I am 

[Chorus:]
What you see is what you get
This is me, hey you
If you want me, don't forget
You should take me as I am
'Cause I can promise you
Baby, what you see is what you get

I know you watch me when I'm dancin'
When I party with me friends
I can feel your eyes on my back, baby
I can't have no chains around me, baby can't you see
I could be anything you dream of, but I gotta feel free
You should never try to change me
I can be nobody else
And I like the way I am

You used to say that I was special
Everything was right
But now you think I'm wearing too much make-up
That my dress is too tight
You got no reasons to be jealous

So does it really matter if they're looking
I'm only looking at you
You should never try to change me
I can be nobody else
And I like the way I am

What you see is what you get
This is me, hey you
If you want me, don't forget
You should take me as I am

Baby, what you see is what you get

I know you watch me when I'm dancin'
When I party with me friends
I can feel your eyes on my back, baby
I can't have no chains around me, baby can't you see
I could be anything you dream of, but I gotta feel free
You should never try to change me
I can be nobody else
And I like the way I am

[Repeat Chorus]

You should never try to change me
I can be nobody else
Believe me, you'll be looking for trouble if you hurt me
I can promise you, you'll be looking for trouble
Believe me, yeah yeah yeah yeah





"Lucky"

This is a story about a girl named Lucky… 

Early morning, she wakes up
Knock, knock, knock on the door
It's time for makeup, perfect smile
It's you they're all waiting for
They go…
"Isn't she lovely, this Hollywood girl?"
And they say…

[CHORUS:]
She's so lucky, she's a star
But she cry, cry, cries in her lonely heart, thinking
If there's nothing missing in my life
Then why do these tears come at night

Lost in an image, in a dream
But there's no one there to wake her up
And the world is spinning, and she keeps on winning
But tell me what happens when it stops?
They go…
"Isn't she lovely, this Hollywood girl?"
And they say…

[Repeat CHORUS]

"Best actress, and the winner is…Lucky!"
"I'm Roger Johnson for Pop News standing outside the arena waiting for Lucky"
"Oh my god…here she comes!"

Isn't she lucky, this Hollywood girl?
She is so lucky, but why does she cry?
If there's nothing missing in her life
Why do tears come at night?

[repeat chorus twice]





"One Kiss From You"

I'm dreaming of one kiss from you
A love long and true
We'll go on and on and… 

I don't wanna hear that I'm too young
To know it's love that makes me feel this way
'Cause I don't have to feel the heat of the sun
To know it's shining on me every day
When it's warm outside
And the look in your eyes
Is longing to show me the way
I don't want to wait

[CHORUS:]
Just one kiss from you, and suddenly
I see the road laid out in front of me
You give me strength, you give me hope
And when you hold me in your arms
You make me whole
And I don't know just what I would do
Without one kiss from you

I don't wanna hear my time will come
When it feels like it's already here
We should learn to walk before we run
But why go anywhere when you're so near
'Cause when I reach out to you
So sad and confused
And feeling like I could cry
You dry my eyes

[Repeat CHORUS]

I'm dreaming of one kiss from you
A love long and true
We'll go on and on and…
I'm looking for one kiss goodnight
To last all my life
On and on and…

[Repeat CHORUS]

I'm looking for one kiss goodnight
To last all my life





"Where are you Now"

Calling out your name
Your face is everywhere
I'm reaching out to you
To find that you're not there
I wake up every night
To see the state I'm in
It's like an endless fight
I never seem to win 

I can't go on as long as I believe
Can't let go when I keep wondering

[CHORUS:]
Where are you now, what have you found
Where is your heart, when I'm not around
Where are you now, you gotta let me know
Oh baby, so I can let you go

I can hear your voice
The ring of yesterday
It seems so close to me
But yet so far away
I should let it out
To save what's left of me
And close the doors of doubt
Revive my dignity

But, I can't go on as long as I believe
Can't let go when I keep wondering

[Repeat CHORUS]

I should let it out, it's time to let you go
Oh baby, I just want to know

[Repeat CHORUS]





"Can't Make You Love Me"

I'm just a girl with a crush on you 

Don't care about money
It doesn't give me half the thrill
To the thought of you, honey
So tell me that you want me still
If only I could trade the fancy cars
For a chance today, it's incomparable
I might be sitting with the movie stars
Everybody say that I have it all

[CHORUS:]
But I can't make you love me
Is it my life or the things I do?
Can't make you love me
I'm just a girl with a crush on you

I have been through changes, yeah
But I'm still the girl you used to know
It's made me no different
So tell me why you had to go
Oh baby, I will trade the fancy cars
For a chance today, it's incomparable
I might be sitting with the movie stars
Everybody say that I just have it all

[Repeat CHORUS]

Just the thought of being close to you
It's incomparable
Should be happy with the life I live
And the things I do
Seems like I have it all

Can't make you, make you love me baby
It's my life, what can I do?
Can't make you love me, alright
I'm just a girl with a crush on you

"Dear Diary"

Dear diary
Today I saw a boy
And I wondered if he noticed me
He took my breath away

Dear diary
I can't get him off my mind
And it scares me
'Cause I've never felt this way

No one in this world
Knows me better than you do
So diary I'll confide in you

Dear diary
Today I saw a boy
As he walked by I thought he smiled at me

And I wondered
Does he know what's in my heart
I tried to smile, but I could hardly breathe

Should I tell him how I feel
Or would that scare him away
Diary, tell me what to do
Please tell me what to say

Dear diary
One touch of his hand
Now I can't wait to see that boy again

He smiled
And I thought my heart could fly
Diary, do you think that we'll be more than friends?
I've got a feeling we'll be so much more than friends





"Girl In The Mirror"

There's a girl in the mirror
I wonder who she is
Sometimes I think I know her
Sometimes I really wish I did
There's a story in her eyes
Lullabies and goodbyes
When she's looking back at me
I can tell her heart is broken easily

'Cause the girl in my mirror
Is crying out tonight
And there's nothing I can tell her
To make her feel alright
Oh the girl in my mirror
Is crying 'cause of you
And I wish there was something
Something I could do

If I could
I would tell her
Not to be afraid
The pain that she's feeling
The sense of loneliness will fade
So dry your tears and rest assured
Love will find you like before
When she's looking back at me
I know nothing really works that easily

'Cause the girl in my mirror
Is crying out tonight
And there's nothing I can tell her
To make her feel alright
Oh the girl in my mirror
Is crying 'cause of you
And I wish there was something
I wish there was something
Oh I wish there was something
I could do

I can't believe it's what I see
That the girl in the mirror
The girl in the mirror
Is me

I can't believe what I see (no....)
(The girl in my mirror)
The girl in my mirror is me
Ohh...is me

'Cause the girl in my mirror
Is crying out tonight
And there's nothing I can tell her
To make her feel alright
Oh the girl in my mirror
Is crying 'cause of you
I wish there was something
I wish there was something
Oh I wish there was something
I could do

"I'm Not A Girl, Not Yet A Woman"

I used to think
I had the answers to everything,
But now I know
Life doesn't always go my way, yeah...
Feels like I'm caught in the middle
That's when I realize...

[Chorus:]
I'm not a girl,
Not yet a woman.
All I need is time,
A moment that is mine,
While I'm in between.

[Verse 2]
I'm not a girl,
There is no need to protect me.
It's time that I
Learn to face up to this on my own.
I've seen so much more than you know now,
So don't tell me to shut my eyes.

[Chorus]

I'm not a girl,
But if you look at me closely,
You will see it in my eyes.
This girl will always find
Her way.

I'm not a girl
(I'm not a girl don't tell me what to believe).
Not Yet a woman
(I'm just trying to find the woman in me, yeah).
All I need is time (All I need),
A moment that is mine (That is mine),
While I'm in between.

I'm not a girl
Not yet a woman (not now)
All I need is time (All I need),
A moment that is mine,
While I'm in between.

I'm not a girl,
Not yet a woman.

"Cinderella"

I used to be your girlfriend and I know I did it well
Oh yes you know its true
You'd call me Cinderella
All you had to do was yell
And I'd be there for you

Here I am
So try to forgive me
I don't believe in fairy tales
Here we are with nothing but honesty
I've had enough
I'm not gonna stay

I'm sorry for running away like this
And I'm sorry I've already made my wish
Oh, But Cinderellas got to go

From time to time I'd try to tell just what was on my mind.
You'd tell me not today.
Come back, do that.
Wheres, Cinderella at...
Was all you had to say

Here I am, so try to forgive me
I don't believe in fairy tales
here we are with nothing but honesty
i've had..enough...i'm not gonna stay

I'm sorry for running away like this 'n i'm sorry
i've already made my wish. Ah, but cinderella's
got to go

i'm sorry just tryin' to live my life
don't worry, you're gonna be alright
but cinderellas got to go.

[spoken]

I used to say I want you, you cast me in your spell.
I did everything you wanted me to, but now i shall..
break free from all your lies. I won't be blind you see,
my love it can't be sacrificed, i won't return to thee.

[sung]
I'm so sorry, i've already made up my mind

[spoken]
I won't return to thee

[sung]
I'm sorry to say, i'm runnin' away now...
don't worry, you will be alright

i'm runnin' away, i've made up my mind now..
your gonna have to let me go

I'm sorry for runnin' away like this, and I'm
sorry I've already made my wish
Oh, but cinderella's got to go
I'm sorry, just tryin' to live my life, don't worry, 
your going to be alright!
but cinderella's got to go.



"Let Me Be"

You try to read me
You try to figure out
You try to breathe me
But you can't blow me out
You try to feel me
But I'm so out of touch
I won't be falling
You won't have to pick me up
Sorry if I sound confused
I don't feel the way you do
But I won't turn around
But I won't turn around

[Chorus:]
Think that I might back down but I won't
Think that I might have doubts but I don't
No insecurities, won't you just let me, let me be?
Think that you know me now but you don't
Think that I can't stand on my own
It ain't my philosophy,
Won't you just let me, let me be?

Trust in my instincts
Trust that I know what's right
These are the reasons
That keep you up at night (at night)
Tell me "Go slow"
This is my flow
'Cause you don't know
Know what I know

Let me tell you how it feels
Baby it's time that you see me for real
Sorry if I sound confused
I don't feel the way you do
But I won't turn around
But I won't turn around

[Chorus]

Trust that I know
This is my show
Letting you know
Gotta go the way I go
Trust that I know
This is my show
Letting you know
Gotta go the way I go

[Chorus x2]

When I Found You"

I believe
We all have one true love
Somewhere in this world
I do (I do, I do)

When it seemed
All my dreams
Were falling through
That's when I found you

I believe for every heart
That whispers in the dark
There's a ray of light somewhere
Shining through
It was sink
Or swim
When the tide came in

I found myself
When I found you
I found the closest thing to heaven
Yes in you
I found the deepest love I knew
Ooooh Ohh
I'll believe
Yes it's true
I found myself
When I found you

Ooh yeah

I believe (I believe)
For every door (Every door)
That's closing
For every heartbreak 
There's hope for something new
From the ashes rise a glimpse of paradise
It still flickered in your eyes

When I found you
I found the closest thing to heaven
Yes in you
I found the deepest love I knew
Ooooh Ohh
I'll believe
Yes it's true
I found myself
When I found you

A life unfolds
No one knows
I thought love was just a tingling of the skin
I felt so alone
All Alone
More than you could ever know
You show deep love
Sweet love

When I found you (I found love)
Oooh (the closest thing to heaven)
Oh yeah
I found you baby, I found you
I found you
Yeah
I found myself

When I found you
I found the closest thing to heaven
Yes in you
I found the deepest love I knew
Ooooh Ohh
I'll believe
Yes it's true
I found myself
When I found you, you

Laying here in your arms
And you hold me tight, tight

And I know that you best be on your way
But I'm wishin' I could make you stay
Stay with me for a while

All the little things that make me weak
Your eyes and the way you speak
Without you baby I'm not me (I'm not me)

Just something a girl’s gotta do, oh

Never thought I’d see you like this
You lookin’ good when you’re half dressed
Just let me give you one last test
Is that a sin, no

Like this

I dare you to stand in my way
Just give in when you are ready to play
Uh, like this

What goes around comes around
And the crowds are waiting, oh

Then we can make up
Shake my body all night
Here comes the showdown, oh

I don’t really wanna be a tease
But would you undo my zipper please
Uh uh, please don’t talk
Listen
I’ll let you touch me if you want
I see your body rise, rise
And when you come, don’t get too hot
Butterfly

I dare you to stand in my way.

"Breathe On Me"

It's so hot in here

Oh, it's so hot, and I need some air.
And boy, don't stop 'cause I'm halfway there
It's not complicated, we're just syncopated
We can read each other's minds.
One love united
Two bodies synchronising
Don't even need to touch me
Baby, just

Breathe on me, yeah, oh
Baby just, breathe on me
We don't need to touch, just
Breathe, oh, yeah

Oh, this is way beyond the physical (it's a way beyond the physical)
Tonight, my senses don't make sense at all
Our imagination, taking us to places
We have never been before
Take me in, let it out
Don't even need to touch me
Baby, just

Breathe on me, yeah, oh baby 
Just, breathe on me.
We don't need to touch, just
Breathe (breathe) on (on) me (me), oh baby 
Just, breathe (breathe) on (on) me (me)
We don't need to touch
Just breathe

Monogamy is the way to go
Just put your lips together and blow

Breathe, breathe, oh

Breathe on me (oh oh) oh
Baby just, breathe on me (on me)
We don't need to touch, just
Breathe (breathe) on (on) me (me) oh
Baby just, breathe (breathe) on (on) me (me)
We don't need to touch, just




"Early Mornin'"

Early mornin'
Alright, I was a little late last night
Got a little messy
Early morning
Can't be like that anymore, oh

[Chorus:]
I was shaking my ass in the streets I'm wrong and
Just walked in and it's early morning
Bump, bump till the break of dawn and
It don't stop till the early morning
Passed out on the couch I'm yawning
Just walked in and it's early morning
Bump, bump till the break of dawn and
It don't stop till the early morning

Met a dark dude, kinda dark hair
When he walked up Tony grabbed him
But I liked him, told him "Come here"
Kinda cool
Baby, we can make plans
Where ya live?
Does your mama live there?
We can hook up at the hotel
Hands down so
I told him, "Let's go"
What happened next, guess what?
You don't wanna know

[Chorus]

Oh, in love
I went out with my girl Jen
And we called up Gabe and his friends
He was talkin' bout hittin' up show
So I said, what the hell
Let's go
Got up, got on the dance floor
Hooked up with a guy named Joe
When the music was fast and slow
But what happened next, guess what?
You don't wanna know

[Chorus]

Call all your boys
Call all your girls
Call all your friends
Let's do it again
Let's do it again

Yes, early morning
Yes, can't keep doin' this

I'll light your fire
Your one desire
Pull on me, baby
And I'll take you higher
[Man:] I wanna get with you
You should try her
So come over here and let's go so

[Chorus]

Call all your boys
Call all your girls
Call all your friends
Let's do it again
Let's do it

Early mornin', early mornin'



"Toxic"

Baby, can’t you see
I’m calling
A guy like you
Should wear a warning
It’s dangerous
I’m fallin’

There’s no escape
I can’t wait
I need a hit
Baby, give me it
You’re dangerous
I’m lovin’ it

Too high
Can’t come down
Losing my head
Spinning ‘round and ‘round
Do you feel me now

With a taste of your lips
I’m on a ride
You're toxic I'm slipping under
With a taste of a poison paradise
I’m addicted to you
Don’t you know that you’re toxic
And I love what you do
Don’t you know that you’re toxic

It’s getting late
To give you up
I took a sip
From my devil's cup
Slowly
It’s taking over me

Too high
Can’t come down
It’s in the air
And it’s all around
Can you feel me now

With a taste of your lips
I’m on a ride
You're toxic I'm slipping under
With a taste of a poison paradise
I’m addicted to you
Don’t you know that you’re toxic
And I love what you do
Don’t you know that you’re toxic

Don't you know that you're toxic

[x2]
With a taste of your lips
I'm on a ride
You're toxic I'm slipping under
With a taste of a poison paradise
I'm addicted to you
Don't you know that you're toxic

Intoxicate me now
With your lovin' now
I think I'm ready now
I think I'm ready now
Intoxicate me now
With your lovin' now
I think I'm ready now

"Touch Of My Hand"

I’m not ashamed of the things that I dream
I find myself flirting with the verge of obscene
Into the unknown, I will be bold
I’m going to places I can be out of control

And I don’t want to explain tonight
All the things I’ve tried to hide
I shut myself out from the world so I
Can draw the blinds and I’ll teach myself to fly

I love myself
It’s not a sin
I can’t control what’s happenin’

‘Cause I just discovered
Imagination’s taking over
Another day without a lover
The more I come to understand
The touch of my hand

From the small of my back and the arch of my feet
Lately I’ve been noticin’ the beautiful me
I’m all in my skin and I’m not gonna wait
I’m into myself in the most precious way

And I don’t want to explain tonight
All the things I’ve tried to hide
I shut myself out from the world so I
Can draw the blinds and I’ll teach myself to fly

‘Cause I just discovered
Imagination’s taking over
Another day without a lover
The more I come to understand
The touch of my hand

There’s a world undefined
In my body and mind 
I won’t be left behind
I’m already here

‘Cause I just discovered
Imagination’s taking over
Another day without a lover
The more I come to understand
The touch of my hand

‘Cause I just discovered
Imagination’s taking over
Another day without a lover
The more I come to understand
The touch of my hand

"Shadow"

Your body’s warm
But you are not
You give a little
Not a lot
You coup your love
Until we kiss
You’re all I want
But not like this
I’m watching you disappear
But you, you were never here

It’s only your shadow
Never yourself
It’s only your shadow
Nobody else
It’s only your shadow
Filling the room
Arriving too late
And leaving too soon
And leaving too soon

Your body gives
But then holds back
The sun is bright
The sky is black
Can only be another sign
I cannot keep what isn’t mine
Your laughter it lingers on
But you, you were almost gone

It’s only your shadow
Never yourself
It’s only your shadow
Nobody else
It’s only your shadow
Filling the room
Arriving too late
And leaving too soon
And leaving too soon

How can I tell if you mean what you say
You say it so loud, but you sound far away
Maybe I had just a glimpse of your soul
Or was that your shadow I saw on the wall
I’m watching you disappear
But you, you were never here

It’s only your shadow
Never yourself
It’s only your shadow
Nobody else
It’s only your shadow
Filling the room
Arriving too late
No, no, no
It’s only your shadow
It’s only your shadow
Nobody else
It’s only your shadow
Arriving too late
And leaving too soon

It’s only your shadow






"Brave New Girl"

She’s gonna pack her bags
She’s gonna find her way
She’s gonna get right out of this
She don’t want New York
She don’t want L.A.
She’s gonna find that special kiss
She don’t want no sleep
She don’t want no high
Oh, like peaches ‘n’ cream
She’s gonna wish on stars and touch the sky
Ah, you know what I mean

She wants a good time
No need to rewind
She needs to really really find what she wants
She lands on both feet
Won’t take a back seat
There’s a brave new girl
And she’s comin’ out tonight

She’s gonna step outside
Uncover her eyes
Who knew she could feel so alive
Her M.O.’s changed
She don’t wanna behave
Ain’t it good to be a brave girl tonight

Tonight, it’s alright
A brave girl tonight

So she met this man 
He was kinda rough
He said, girl, whatcha lookin’ for
She said, I don’t know
I go with the flow
He said, let’s get on the floor
He said, you look real cute with your low ride jeans
And your pink little baby tee
Let’s get a room, girl
Come and ride with me

She wants a good time
No need to rewind
She needs to really really find what she wants
She lands on both feet
Won’t take a back seat
There’s a brave new girl
And she’s comin' out tonight

She’s gonna step outside
Uncover her eyes
Who knew she could feel so alive
Her M.O.’s changed 
She don’t wanna behave
Ain’t it good to be a brave girl tonight

Tonight, it’s alright
A brave girl tonight
Tonight, it’s alright
A brave girl tonight

[Digital:] I must keep on moving
Who knew she could feel so alive

She’s gonna step outside
Uncover her eyes
Who knew she could feel so alive
Her M.O.’s changed
She don’t wanna behave
Ain’t it good to be a brave girl tonight
Tonight it’s alright
A brave girl tonight

Tonight, it’s alright
A brave girl tonight
A brave girl tonight
A brave girl tonight






"Everytime"

Notice me
Take my hand
Why are we
Strangers when
Our love is strong
Why carry on without me?

Everytime I try to fly
I fall without my wings
I feel so small
I guess I need you baby
And everytime I see you in my dreams
I see your face, it's haunting me
I guess I need you baby

I make believe
That you are here
It's the only way
I see clear
What have I done
You seem to move on easy

And everytime I try to fly
I fall without my wings
I feel so small
I guess I need you baby
And everytime I see you in my dreams
I see your face, you're haunting me
I guess I need you baby

I may have made it rain
Please forgive me
My weakness caused you pain
And this song's my sorry

Oh

At night I pray
That soon your face
Will fade away

And everytime I try to fly
I fall without my wings
I feel so small
I guess I need you baby
And everytime I see you in my dreams
I see your face, you're haunting me
I guess I need you baby

Someday (I Will Understand)"

[Verse 1:]
Nothing seems to be the way
That it used to
Everything seems shallow
God give me truth
In me
And tell me somebody is watching
Over me
And that is all I'm praying is that

Someday I will understand
In God's whole plan
And what he's done to me
Oh but maybe
Someday I will breathe
And I'll finally see
I'll see it all in my baby

[Verse 2:]
Don't you run too fast my dear
Why don't you stop?
Just stop and listen to your tears
They're all you've got
It's in you
You see somebody is watching
Over you
And that is all I'm praying is that

Someday you will understand
In God's whole plan
And what he does to you
Oh but maybe
Someday you will breathe
And you'll finally see
You'll see it all in your baby
You'll see it all in your baby

No moment
Will be more true
Than the moment
I look at you

It's in you
You see somebody is watching
Over you
And that is all I'm praying is that

Someday you will understand
In God's whole plan
And what he does to you
Oh but maybe
Someday you will breathe
And you'll finally see
You'll see it all in your baby
You'll see it all in your baby
You'll see it all in your baby
You'll see it all in your baby

(Burning up the dance floor)
Do you like the way I rock it
Boy it's chaotic






"Mona Lisa"

[intro (spoken)]
This is the story about... Mona Lisa

About Mona Lisa

Mona Lisa

[verse 1]
Ladies and Gentlemen, I've got a little story to tell
About Mona Lisa, and how she suddenly fell (huh)
See everyone knew her, they knew her oh so well
Now I am taking over, to release her from her spell

[chorus]
She's the original, she's unforgettable
She wants you to know (yeah) she's been gone
It's kind of incredible
She's so unpredictable (yeah, yeah)
She wants you to know (yeah) cuz she's been gone, cuz she's been gone, cuz she's been gone

[verse 2]
She was taken under, drowning in her seat (huh)
Running like an angel, she was crying and she could not see (oh no!)
Now see everyone's watching, as she starts to fall
They want her to break down
There will be a legend of her fall...

[repeat chorus]

[verse 3]
Now Ladies does that make you cry? (huh)
Mona Lisa's got to fly
Nobody really does
Everyone, may we have a moment of silence? Right Here.

[chorus 2x]





"Over To You Now"

[Spoken]
Do you like this?
This place that I’m bringing you to?
Because I do…
Oh my God….

[Verse 1]
I know this place
It’s still a secret
And I don’t think you’ve ever been
It’s kinda hard
To find the entrance
You need some juice
But you’ll love it once you get in
This special place it’s in the basement
You have to work your way around
The place is hot and then it’s pumping
So are you ready to go down?

[Chorus]
So it’s over to you now
So it’s over to you now (now, now, yeah)
And it’s over to you now
Can’t you see what I’m thinking-king-king?
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah

[Verse 2]
If you behave
You might be chosen
Just read the flyer
And it tells you how to get there
And when you come
You might be stunned
So baby whatchu waiting for?

[Chorus]
So it’s over to you now
So it’s over to you now (now, now, yeah)
And it’s over to you now
Can’t you see what I’m thinking-king-king?
So it’s over to you now
So it’s over to you now (now, now, yeah)
And it’s over to you now
Can’t you see what I’m thinking-king-king?
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah

[Spoken]
Do you like this?
This place that I’m bringing you to?
Do you feel that? Huh? (Giggles)
Do like that?
I thought you would….
Cause I do.
Oh my God

[Chorus]
So it’s over to you now
So it’s over to you now (now, now, yeah)
And it’s over to you now
Can’t you see what I’m thinking-king-king?
So it’s over to you now
So it’s over to you now (now, now, yeah)
And it’s over to you now
Can’t you see what I’m thinking-king-king?
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah…..

[Spoken]
Oh my God





"Toxic (Peter Rauhofer Reconstruction Mix)"

Baby, can't you see 
I'm calling 
A guy like you 
Should wear a warning 
It's dangerous 
I'm fallin' 

There's no escape 
I can't hide 
I need a hit 
Baby, give me it 
You're dangerous 
I'm lovin' it 

Too high 
Can't come down 
Losing my head 
Spinning 'round and 'round 
Do you feel me now 

With a taste of your lips 
I'm on a ride 
You're toxic 
I'm slipping under 
With a taste of poison paradise 
I'm addicted to you 
Don't you know that you're toxic 
And I love what you do 
Don't you know that you're toxic 

It's getting late 
To give it up 
I took a sip 
From my devil cup 
Slowly 
It's taking over me 

Too high 
Can't come down 
It's in the air 
And it's all around 
Can you feel me now 

With a taste of your lips 
I'm on a ride 
You're toxic 
I'm slipping under 
With a taste of poison paradise 
I'm addicted to you 
Don't you know that you're toxic 
And I love what you do 
Don't you know that you're toxic 

Don't you know that you're toxic 

Taste of my lips and having fun 

With a taste of your lips 
I'm on a ride 
You're toxic 
I'm slipping under 
With a taste of poison paradise 
I'm addicted to you 
Don't you know that you're toxic 
And I love what you do 
Don't you know that you're toxic 

With a taste of your lips 
I'm on a ride 
You're toxic 
I'm slipping under 
With a taste of poison paradise 
I'm addicted to you 
Don't you know that you're toxic 
And I love what you do 
Don't you know that you're toxic 

I'm intoxicated now 
I think you'll love it now 
I think I'm ready now 
I think I'm ready now 
I'm intoxicated now 
I think you'll love it now 
I think I'm ready now

"Touch Of My Hand (Bill Hamel Remix)"

I'm not ashamed of the things that I dream 
I find myself flirting with the verge of obscene 
Into the unknown, I will be bold 
I'm going to places I can be out of control 

And I don't want to explain tonight 
All the things I've tried to hide 
I shut myself out from the world so I 
Can draw the blinds and I'll teach myself to fly 

I love myself 
It's not a sin 
I can't control what's happenin' 

'Cause I just discovered 
Imagination's taking over 
Another day without a lover 
The more I come to understand 
The touch of my hand 

From the small of my back and the arch of my feet 
Lately I've been noticin' the beautiful me 
I'm all in my skin and I'm not gonna wait 
I'm into myself in the most precious way 

And I don't want to explain tonight 
All the things I've tried to hide 
I shut myself out from the world so I 
Can draw the blinds and I'll teach myself to fly 

'Cause I just discovered 
Imagination's taking over 
Another day without a lover 
The more I come to understand 
The touch of my hand 

There's a world undifined 
And my body is mine 
I won't be left behind 
I'm already here 

'Cause I just discovered 
Imagination's taking over 
Another day without a lover 
The more I come to understand 
The touch of my hand 

'Cause I just discovered 
Imagination's taking over 
Another day without a lover 
The more I come to understand 
The touch of my hand






"Breathe On Me (Jacques Lu Cont's Thin White Duke Mix)"

It's so hot in here 

Oh, it's so hot, and I need some air. 
Oh boy, don't stop 'cos I'm halfway there 
It's not complicated, we're just syncopated 
We can read each other's minds. 
One love united 
Two bodies synchronising 
Don't even need to touch me 
Baby, just 

Breathe on me, yeah, oh 
Baby just, breathe on me 
We don't need to touch, just 
Breathe, oh, yeah 

Oh, this is way beyond the physical (it's a way beyond the physical) 
Tonight, my senses don't make sense at all 
Our imagination, taking us to places 
We have never been before 
Take me in, let it out 
Don't even need to touch me 
Baby, just 

Breathe on me, yeah, oh baby 
Just, breathe on me. 
We don't need to touch, just 
Breathe (breathe) on (on) me (me), oh baby 
Just, breathe (breathe) on (on) me (me) 
We don't need to touch 
Just breathe 

Monogamy is the way to go 
Just put your lips together and blow 

Breathe, breathe, oh 

Breathe on me (oh oh) oh 
Baby just, breathe on me (on me) 
We don't need to touch, just 
Breathe (breathe) on (on) me (me) oh 
Baby just, breathe (breathe) on (on) me (me) 
We don't need to touch, just

"Welcome To Me (Love)"

You got me thinking about
The things I'd do to your body
(Yeah)
I can almost taste your lips
I can feel how much you want me

But to think what you wanna do to me
Close your eyes and visualize me
Go with it, flow with it
Come on, be a man
Take control of it

Let's get outta here
'Cause you know that we're
Gonna love tonight
Got a private spot
That's not all I got
For you, tonight

Your eyes are burning through me
I'm not afraid of your fire
I can almost taste your lips
I can feel how much you want me
But to think what you wanna do to me
Close your eyes and visualize me
Go with it, flow with it
Come on, be a man
Take control of it

Let's get outta here
'Cause you know that we're
Gonna love, tonight
Got a private spot
That's not all I got
For you, tonight

There are places that I know,
No one else can ever go
But you & me..
Welcome to me

Let's get outta here
'Cause you know that we're
Gonna love, tonight
Got a private spot
That's not all I got
For you, tonight






"Walk On By"

I'm coming down with a heartache tonight 
Only you can make it all right 
If I can be with you holding you tight 
There won't be no more in my life 

Every where I turn 
I see your face 
Reminding me of a higher place 
Every time you smile 
Angels cry 
Every time you walk on by 

I'm not the only 
Feeling lonely 
Every time you walk on by 
I try to say something 
But end up with nothing 
Every time you walk on by

(Every time you walk on by) 

I keep my cool I pretend I'm not here 
Every time you come too near 
I'm such a fool 'cause, this love is true and 
If I don't tell you someone else surely will 

Every where I turn 
I see your face 
Reminding me of a higher place 
Every time you smile 
Angels cry 
Every time you walk on by 

I'm not the only 
Feeling lonely 
Every time you walk on by 
I try to say something 
But end up with nothing 
Every time you walk on by

(Feeling lonely) 

If I ever see you again 
This craziness must find an end 
I look at you
I promise myself

I'm not the only
Feeling lonely
Every time you walk on by
I try to say something 
But end up with nothing 
Every time you walk on by 

I'm not the only 
Feeling lonely 
Every time you walk on by
I try to say something 
But end up with nothing 
Every time you walk on by 

Every time you walk on by







"Unbroken"

I can't believe I'm falling again
Just when I thought never again
Something by the way you make me innocent again
Now you're here making me yours
Like all I have was made to be yours
Like everything that came before
Was waiting to be yours

The way I let you in when I'm letting go
How you make me spin in the afterglow
The way you let me in when you're letting go
Baby did you know? I gotta let you know:

You put the pieces back together
Make me feel like I was never open
You make me feel unbroken

It's the first time that I did this
It's the first time everything is showing
You make me feel unbroken

Uh-uh-uh-uh uh-uh-uh uh
Uh-uh-uh-uh uh-uh-uh uh
Uh-uh-uh-uh uh-uh-uh unbroken.

All my stars are coming undone
When you got me coming undone
Like all the damage to my heart is finally undone

The way I let you in when I'm letting go
How you make me spin in the afterglow
The way you let me in when you're letting go
Baby did you know? I gotta let you know:

You put the pieces back together
Make me feel like I was never open
You make me feel unbroken

It's the first time that I did this
It's the first time everything is showing
You make me feel unbroken

Uh-uh-uh-uh uh-uh-uh uh
Uh-uh-uh-uh uh-uh-uh uh
Uh-uh-uh-uh uh-uh-uh unbroken

It's cause you say it like you mean it
It's cause you say it and I believe it
It's kind of like I saved it all up
I saved it all for you

You put the pieces back together
Make me feel like I was never open
You make me feel unbroken

It's the first time that I did this
It's the first time everything is showing
You make me feel unbroken

Uh-uh-uh-uh uh-uh-uh uh
Uh-uh-uh-uh uh-uh-uh uh
Uh-uh-uh-uh uh-uh-uh unbroken

Uh-uh-uh-uh uh-uh-uh uh
Uh-uh-uh-uh uh-uh-uh uh
Uh-uh-uh-uh uh-uh-uh unbroken









"To Love Let Go"

It's written everywhere 
I've even read it in my script 
But when I thought it wasn't fair 
I felt it on my lips, let go 
I don't wanna be the one 
I think you already know, oh 

The feeling of going down way too deep 
Holding on 
So you won't lose your feet 
Sometimes you just gotta trust 
You gotta take that leap 
And let go 
Gotta let go 

I've got a feeling 
By your look you're through 
Oh no 
What you're revealing 
I sit and pray 
And I will pull through, oh no yeah 

When you let go 
Of all you've known 
The butterflies fly 
And you will see the rainbows 
And all the love 
Everything will be shown 
So let go 
Let go 

The touch of grass 
The air 
The sun it will rise 
You will see so clear 
It will bring tears to your eyes 
Maybe everything will be alright 
So let go 
You gotta let go 

I've got a feeling 
Right now 
You feel it too 
Oh, oh 
This little song 
Might be the one 
That will tell us what to do 
Oh, oh, ooh, ooh 

These tears are overflowing 
And never knowing why 
All these years we've been 
We've been hurting 
We have to look inside 
And try 
To let go 

You gotta let go 
To love, you gotta let go 
If you really wanna love 
You gotta let go

"This Kiss"

There was a time when you were mine
There was a time when you helped me to hide, baby
And now you're around me
Boy, I wish you could find me, oh oh

This kiss, this kiss, this kiss
Just wants you, oh baby
This kiss, this kiss, this kiss
Just loves you, my friend

"Strangest Love"

Stuck here
So far from home
Talking
But they don't know

Can't make sense of the signs
I thought I would die
Till you looked in my eyes

Till something changes
It's a different language
It's words say too much and get in the way of me talking the strangest love

I never had
Any where to go
Nothing
I've been here all alone

No one to show me
No one can hear me
Baby just tell me

Till something changes
It's a different language
It's words say too much and get in the way of me talking the strangest love

Till something changes
It's a different language
It's words say too much and get in the way of me talking the strangest love

I don't have to know what you're saying
I don't have to be afraid no more
Don't talk no more
That's not what words are for

Till something changes
Till something changes
It's a different language
It's words say too much and get in the way of me talking the strangest love

Strangest love
Strangest love
Strangest love
Strangest love







"State Of Grace"

Love is a state of grace 
Transcending time and space 
No other way I can describe 
Insanely beautiful 
It's almost mystical 
Cause you're mine 
And I can't believe that I feel 
What I feel 
Such a strange kind of 'real' 
Love is a state of grace 
Between you and I 

Golden, broken 
I didn't know 
One touch could open 
My body and soul 
And we've just begun 
Like the moon and sun 
We fade to one 

Love is a state of grace 
Transcending time and space 
No other way I can describe 
Insanely beautiful 
It's almost mystical 
Cause you're mine 
And I can't believe that I feel 
What I feel 
Such a strange kind of 'real' 
Love is a state of grace 
Between you and I 

And the way 
That we feel 
Is a dream 
That we know is real 
Love is a state of grace 
Love is a state of grace 

Love is a state of grace 
Transcending time and space 
No other way I can describe 
Insanely beautiful 
It's almost mystical 
Cause you're mine 
Love is a state of grace




"Sippin' On"
(feat. A.C.)

We goin' out tonight
This is gonna be a hot one baby

[AC:]
(Ay oh) let me do my thing with a New York verse
AC will make you hot, girl remove your shirt
I got my eyes closed you could do your dirt
And by the way, do you still got that school girl skirt?
Like the cops imma watch her watch me
Shot with a chaser like the paparazzi
Its crazy she still on top a the biz
I'm with Brit, while KFed watchin' the kids

[Britney (Verse 1):]
He was kinda like a summer fling
Hot and heavy through that April rain
May and June he was after me
By July, it was getting hypnotic
So he kinda started feelin my fame
I don't really wanna say his name
All I know is I liked his drank
All my girls say mmm if you feel me
I saw you there, I cant get you out my sight boy
Better go and get another drank, cuz you aint getting none of mine, no

[Chorus:]
Ohh, tell me whatcha sippin on
Baby, baby, baby
Ohh, tell me whatcha sippin on
Baby, baby, baby

[Britney (Verse 2):]
What I feel is more than a crush
Then again, its not quite love
Just enough to fill my cup
Whatever you do, just keep it flowin'
So tell me how you like it babe
On the rocks, or straight up babe
Oh boy don't be afraid, I'm right here and I'm gonna show ya
I saw you there, I can't get you outta my mind, boy
Better go and get another drink
All my girls say

[Chorus:]
Ohh, ohh, tell me whatcha sippin' on
Baby, baby, baby
Ohh, tell me whatcha sippin' on
Baby, baby, baby

I can't ignore it boy I feel like I'm yours
The way you look at me I just can't say no
So we should hook up, who knows where we will go
Cause baby when I'm with you, I feel I'm losing control

Oh boy you hit the spot
See baby, please don't stop
Do you like my lemon drop (just taste it baby)
You make me feel so hot
Summertime love is all we got
Here we are, lets take a shot
(this is AC baby)

[AC:]
All the tabloids tell me how you was a handful
Toxic, try to make you an example
You know me, I'm just tryin' to have you shoot for the airport(?)
Cause all this stress got me losing my hair too
Lets release, get live on the track
Got my baby in the whip, she could ride on my lap
Put that one finger up mommy, guzzle some more
Tell them the only issues you got is the covers your on, uh
One more drink, make us some a the bomb
Order shot, bartender gave one in the arm
All you rappers better recognize the best
Cuz AC about to blow like a breathalyzer test

[Chorus:]
Ohh, ohh, tell me whatcha sippin on
Ohh, tell me whatcha sippin on
Baby, baby, baby

So clap
Baby that's so clap
So clap (so clap common)
Are you ready for that's so clap
So clap, are you ready for that's so clap
So clap, are you ready for that's so clap
So clap, are you ready for that so clap





"She'll Never Be Me"

You know I'm one of a kind;
Boy what's this I see,
Your girl - she looks just like me,
Blond hair and dressed to a T,
You tell me how can this be,
Does she know I was the one,
Who used to turn you on,
Yeah,
But you don't want to talk about it
Well you think you can find
Someone to fill my shoes
And you ask yourself why
She dont do the things I do
And you can't deny
That everywhere you go
You see my face, hear my name
And it eats you up inside

[CHORUS:]
You know I'm one of a kind
There'll never be another me
Can't get me out of your mind
You're lost in your own fantasy
And when you look in my eyes
Is it hard for you to realize
She'll never be me

Why can't you see it girl?
Got no identity
Whenever he's touching you
He's really thinking of me
You tell me "How can this be?"
Does she know I was the one
Who use to turn you on, yeah
But you don't want to talk about it
And the way you must feel
You got to be confused
And you ask yourself why
She don't do the things I do
And you can't deny
That everywhere you go
You see my face, hear my name
And it eats you up inside

[CHORUS]

Don't you think that she would see through you
But you don't want to think about it
Try so hard to do the thing I do
But you don't want to think about it

[CHORUS x2]

She'll never be me

Love is great, love is fine
Out the box, out of line
The affliction of the feeling
Leaves me wanting more

[Chorus]
Cause I may be bad
But I’m perfectly good at it
Sex in the air
I don’t care
I love the smell of it
Sticks and stones
May break my bones
But chains and whips
Excite me

Nothing comes better

"Rockstar"

[Laughs]
Whoo, yeah
I'mma just let y'all know somethin' like this, yeah
[Laughs]
Gonna break it down for all you girls out there

You got your ass on your shoulders and you wonder why nobody ever really wanna get down and hang with you (uh, nobody really wants to go out with you)
Cause You only hang around with fake people that barely even know you, kiss your ass, and love to agree with you (agree with you, it's all in your mind)
You should take a look around when your down by yourself all alone and you'll see who's standin there next to you (no one but you, gonna let you know that)
No wonder why you up and change your number every time you a blind bitch, you're cryin, nobody gave a damn but you (nobody gave a damn but you baby, damn but you)

(Yeah, yeah) so where did you get that game
You don't even know my name
So who do you think you are
You a wannabe rockstar (ho)

So get off of your own throne (get off your own throne baby)
Maybe you'll be alone
By the time you hear this song
You a wannabe rockstar

XO, no love I'm gonna give you
XO, oh love I never knew you
XO, know what, I never loved you
XO, XO, XO, XO

XO, no love I'm gonna give you (I can't give it to you)
XO, oh love I never knew you (I never knew you)
XO, know what, I never loved you (nope, ahh)
XO, XO, XO, XO, XO, XO, XO, XO

You call every minute of the day, every second of the hour cause you're trying to come back but it's way too late (haha, that's what you said, not me)
How's it feel all alone on your throne and the crowd is gone [laughs] and you're holdin on (Why you wanna hold on baby)
So I saw you at the bar with your head up high but you're so down low and it's only cause you don't even know (you don't even know, it's so sad, you know)
It's sad when people, they can't even recognize, that they don't have a clue (they don't have a clue)

You a wannabe rockstar
XO, no love I'm gonna give you (yeah)
XO, oh love I never knew you (yeah)
XO, know what, I never loved you (yeah)
XO, XO, XO, XO

XO, no love I'm gonna give you
XO, oh love I never knew you (knew you)
XO, know what, I never loved you
XO, XO, XO, XO, XO, XO, XO, XO

I hate to break it to you (I hate to break it to you)
But I'm not thinking about you (na ah)
You're so wraped up (yep) in you're boys full of noise don't know, go ask all your boys then (that's really sad)
You talk so much, but so what 
Please won't you shut yourself up (shut the fuck up) [laughs]
So all my girls scream and shout
If you've got an XO
get him right back

yeah, yeah, yeah, oh
XO
Oh, oh, oh 
XO, XO

You a wannabe rockstar
XO, no love I'm gonna give you (yeah)
XO, oh love I never knew you (yeah)
XO, know what, I never loved you (yeah)
XO, XO, XO, XO, XO

XO, no love I'm gonna give you
XO, oh love I never knew you (knew you)
XO, know what, i never 
know what, I never
know what, I never
know what, I never loved you



Are you ready for me?
Yeah? I Thought So

No, Nothing will stop it
You can waste your time
Yeah you feel desire
You made up your mind

Feel it, Taste the victory
Feel it, Burning
Burning inside of me

Right Now (Hey)
I will be your champion
This is where we belong
Making it happen, now (Hey)
Nothing will stop us
Won't pull us under
It's gonna start
Right Now

There is no end to this, no
As far as I can see
And we will not falter (will not falter)
Yeah, we can share the dream

Feel it, Taste the victory
Feel it, Burning
Burning inside of me

Right Now (Hey)
I will be your champion
This is where we belong
Making it happen, now (Hey)
Nothing will stop us
Won't pull us under
It's gonna start
Right Now

Here we go (Who, Who said that) [x3]
Here we go
You wanna do this?

Right Now (Hey)
I will be your champion
This is where we belong
Making it happen, now (Hey)
Nothing will stop us
Won't pull us under
It's gonna start

Right Now (Hey)
I will be your champion
This is where we belong
Making it happen, now (Hey)
Nothing will stop us
Won't pull us under
It's gonna start
It's gonna start
Right Now

You might not believe it
But trust me this is true
You fall for their poison
And become a part of their crew
I'm in a rebellion
And I'm up against the truth
So will you join me?
Or will you be taken too?

You'll find it in rebellion
Your body starts breaking in
They're not believing what they're seeing
'Cause you're rebellion

You'll find it so compelling
'Cause everyone's yelling
'Cause your soul you're not selling
'Cause you're rebellion

Be wary of others
The ones closest to you
The poison they feed you
And the voodoo that they do
But in rebellion there's a sparkle of truth
Don't just stand there
Do what you got to do

You'll find it in rebellion
You'll finally start breathing
They're not believing what they're seeing
'Cause you're rebellion

You'll find it so compelling
With everyone yelling
'Cause your soul you're not selling
'Cause you're rebellion

The eye that is deceiving is the one trapping us in
I'm fighting a losing battle and my patience is wearing thin
But in rebellion there's a glimmer of light
And nobody claims the crown without some sacrifice 

You'll find it in rebellion
You'll finally start breathing
They're not believing what they're seeing
'Cause you're rebellion

You'll find it so compelling
'Cause everyone's yelling
'Cause your soul you're not selling
'Cause you're rebellion

[Intro/Chorus:]
All around the world, pretty girls
Wipe the floor with all the boys
Pour the drinks, bring the noise
(It's Iggy-Iggs!)
We're just so pretty!
All around the world, pretty girls
Jump the line, to the front
Do what we like, get what we want
(Where you at, Brit?)
We're just so pretty!

[Verse 1: Britney Spears]
Hey, don't you know that it's always the same?
From Australia 'round to LA
You can betcha', wherever the girls go, boys follow
We be keeping them up on their toes
They can laugh, but they don't get the jokes
Just you watch, they're so predictable
(Some things don't change...)

[Pre-Chorus:]
(The girls roll up)
Windows roll down
(Eyes on us)
Jaws on the ground
(Watch them go)
It's just so funny
(Like bees to the honey!)

[Chorus: Both]
All around the world, pretty girls
Wipe the floor with all the boys
Pour the drinks, bring the noise
We're just so pretty!
All around the world, pretty girls
Jump the line, to the front
Do what we like, get what we want
We're just so pretty!

[Verse 2: Britney Spears]
Tell me, is it true that these men are from Mars?
Is that why they be acting bizarre?
Every time I walk out of my house it's like, "Hey, baby!"
They don't see me rolling my eyes
They buzzing around me like flies
They got one thing on their minds
(Some things don't change...)

[Pre-Chorus:]
(The girls roll up)
Windows roll down
(Eyes on us)
Jaws on the ground
(Watch them go)
It's just so funny
(Like bees to the honey!)

[Chorus: Both]
All around the world, pretty girls
Wipe the floor with all the boys
Pour the drinks, bring the noise
We're just so pretty!
All around the world, pretty girls
Jump the line, to the front
Do what we like, get what we want
We're just so pretty!

[Bridge: Iggy Azalea]
Damn, still killing them softly
I would spend time with you but that'd cost me
They pray that Iggy-Iggy give 'em one more chance
But busy Iggy wouldn't even give 'em one more glance
See, it's a thin line between the beauty and the beast
Slim waist, thick cake, the whole world want a piece
Bad girl, good (ooh) would make you lose your mind
All of the boys begging Britney, hit 'em one more time
Iggs

[Chorus: Both]
All around the world, pretty girls
Wipe the floor with all the boys
Pour the drinks, bring the noise
We're just so pretty!
All around the world, pretty girls
Jump the line, to the front
Do what we like, get what we want
We're just so pretty!




[Britney]
Yeah
Yeah
Would you rather I dim the lights
Would you prefer, just like we were
Or shall I undress for you (What do you want me to do)
However may I pleasure you

Fill with bubbles
Warm you a bath
Lay back relax
Anything you ask
Let me release the stress for you
However may I pleasure you

[Britney & Don Philip]
You’re so perfect
That I get nervous
Tonight I’m at your service
I’m so unselfish
And though I am helpless, whatever brings you pleasure

[Chorus]
You’re the reason I need
And all that I have to give
Is all I ever wanna do
Is whatever pleasures you
And if it takes me all night
Or for the rest of my life
I’ll spend forever breaking through
Do whatever just to pleasure you
(Hey Britney, it’s Don Phillip)

[Don Philip]
Any fantasy can occur
Will be observed
Just say the word
I’ll do it if you want me to
Whatever just to pleasure you
If you wanna get off from that
Lay on your back
I got the max
Certainly I’ll pull you through
Whatever just to pleasure you

[Britney & Don Philip]
You’re so perfect
That I get nervous
Tonight I’m at your service
I’m so unselfish
And though I am helpless, whatever brings you pleasure

[Chorus]
You’re the reason I need
And all that I have to give
Is all I ever wanna do
Is whatever pleasures you
And if it takes me all night
Or for the rest of my life
I’ll spend forever breaking through
Do whatever just to pleasure you

[Bridge]
If I
Pleasure
Together
Whatever
Whenever
Baby, with you

And it’s Like
Heaven
Together
No matter
Whatever
As long as you ask me too (what do you want me to do)

[Chorus]
You’re the reason I need
And all that I have to give
Is all I ever wanna do
Is whatever pleasures you
And if it takes me all night
Or for the rest of my life
I’ll spend forever breaking through
Do whatever just to pleasure you

You’re the reason I need
And all that I have to give
Is all I ever wanna do
Is whatever pleasures you
And if it takes me all night
Or for the rest of my life
I’ll spend forever breaking through
Do whatever just to pleasure you




Night, day
Shadows
Got me wishing that I'm all alone
Light a candle
Disconnect my telephone.

Runaway
To the 'morrow
Forget where we are.
Throw away
All we follow
'Cause I can't see anymore.
Yeah yeah

Turn, let it burn
Try not to breathe in
All of the plastic.
Learn, when will we learn?
Just to be more
Be more elastic

We can bend, we can mold
When we break, we'll let go
Of the plastic, of the plastic

We can bend, we can mold
When we break, we'll let go
Of the plastic, of the plastic

Voices, echo
Like a hook on the radio
Visions, [?]
I still, want to...

Runaway
To the 'morrow
Forget where we are.
Throw away
All we follow
'Cause I can't see anymore.
Yeah yeah

Turn, let it burn
Try not to breathe in
All of the plastic.
Learn, when will we learn?
Just to be more
Be more elastic

We can bend, we can mold
When we break, we'll let go
Of the plastic, of the plastic

We can bend, we can mold
When we break, we'll let go
Of the plastic, of the plastic

You don't understand
We don't have to stand alone
Sittin' on our hands
Waitin' for a chance
'cause I got you babe,
I got you babe, I got you babe
I wanna know.
I don't need a drug, I'm alive
Tryin' to make you understand
No matter what, not afraid to be your friend,
I got you babe, I got you babe
I wanna know.

You don't understand
We don't have to stand alone
Sittin' on our hands
Waitin' for a chance
'cause I got you babe,

Tryin' to make you understand
No matter what, not afraid to be your friend,

Turn, let it burn
Try not to breathe in
All of the plastic.
Learn, when will we learn?
Just to be more
Be more elastic

We can bend, we can mold
When we break, we'll let go
Of the plastic, of the plastic

We can bend, we can mold
When we break, we'll let go
Of the plastic, of the plastic.

Like you're my friend
And everything is O.K.

Then we shall begin
To put an end
To all the games that we play

My body's a temple
I'll choose who worships it
Let's keep it simple
No need for a big deal

So if you're ready
Just call me on the phone
I'll be here waiting
No need to be alone

Ouch, your heart, you're burning me up
Please don't stop, you're making me blush
Ouch, my God, you hit my spot
I just can't get enough of you, of you, of you, of you

So, say how have you been
How's your girlfriend
It's funny you're here with me
When you're still with her
And I do prefer
That we don't feel guilty

My body is a temple 
I'll choose who worships it
let's keep it simple
No need for a big deal

So if you are ready
Then this is what I'll do
I'll take my time to ***
You used to use me too

Oh, you do
Ooh,here we go

Ouch, don't stop,you‘re burning me up
Please don't stop,you‘re making me blush
Ouch, don't stop,you hit my spot
I just can't get enough of you
Of you, of you, of you

Do you remember?
How we used to do
I was your girlfriend
We were so true
Let's play pretend






You don't have to look like a movie star
Ooh I think you're good just the way you are
Tell me if you could would you up and run away with me?

You don't have to roll like a millionaire
Baby I would go with you anywhere
We don't need no gold, we'll be shining anyway, we'll see

You know can't nobody get down like us
We don't stop 'till we get enough
C'mon, turn it up 'till the speakers pop
Break it down, show me what you've got

Ooh my my baby don't be shy
I see that spark flashing in your eye
My heart beats fast 'cause I want it all
So baby come with me and be my ooh la la

Take my hand, we can go all night
And spin me round just the way I like
It feels so good, I don't wanna stop
So baby come with me and be my ooh la la

You don't have to wear no designer clothes
Just as long as we're dancing on the floor
Fingers in my hair and I'm letting go tonight, so free

You know can't nobody get down like us
We don't stop 'till we get enough
C'mon, turn it up 'till the speakers pop
Break it down, show me what you've got

Ooh my my baby don't be shy
I see that spark flashing in your eye
My heart beats fast 'cause I want it all
So baby come with me and be my ooh la la

Take my hand, we can go all night
And spin me round just the way I like
It feels so good, I don't wanna stop
So baby come with me and be my ooh la la

[Break]

Ooh my my baby don't be shy
I see that spark flashing in your eye

Ooh my my baby don't be shy
I see that spark flashing in your eye
My heart beats fast 'cause I want it all
So baby come with me and be my ooh la la

Take my hand, we can go all night
And spin me round just the way I like
It feels so good, I don't wanna stop
So baby come with me and be my ooh la la

Baby come with me and be my ooh la la
So baby come with me and be my ooh la la




[Spoken:]
People can take everything away from you
But they can never take away your truth
But the question is..
Can you handle mine?

They say I'm crazy
I really don't care
That's my prerogative
They say I'm nasty
But I don't give a damn
Getting boys is how I live
Some ask me questions
Why am I so real?
But they don't understand me
I really don't know the deal about my sister
Trying hard to make it right
Not long ago
Before I won this fight

[Chorus:]

Everybody's talking all this stuff about me
Why don't they just let me live?
I don't need permission, make my own decisions
That's my prerogative
that's my prerogative 
(it's my prerogative)

It's the way that I wanna live (it's my prerogative)
You can’t tell me what to do

Don't get me wrong
I'm really not souped
Ego trips is not my thing
All these strange relationships really gets me down
I see nothing wrong in spreading myself around

Everybody's talking all this stuff about me
Why don't they just let me live?
I don't need permission, make my own decisions
That's my prerogative
That’s my prerogative 

Everybody's talking all this stuff about me
Why don't they just let me live?
I don't need permission, make my own decisions
That's my prerogative
that's my prerogative 

It's the way that I wanna live (it's my prerogative)
You can’t tell me what to do

why can't I live my life
without all of the things
That people say 
oh oh

Everybody's talking all this stuff about me
Why don't they just let me live?
I don't need permission, make my own decisions
That's my prerogative (they say I’m crazy)

Everybody's talking all this stuff about me
Why don't they just let me live? (they say I’m nasty)
I don't need permission, make my own decisions
That's my prerogative
(it's my prerogative)



Last night I took a walk in the snow.
Couples holding hands, places to go
Seems like everyone but me is in love.

I'm about to go crazy

I know you wanna get in my head
I'd rather get in yours instead
Boy you knock me off my feet
This girl bring the heat

Don't forget to paint the town
I know you wanna hear my sound
Don't try to be too tough

Don't take this out of context 
But when it comes to being the best
There ain't no contest 
You should know by now my name's synonymous

With all the hottest hits I keep them breathless
It's endless
Boy relentless

People pay me complements (you're so wonderful)
Boosting up my confidence
All it takes common sense
All it takes is money, love and happiness

Money, love and happiness
Money, love and happiness
Happiness, happiness, money, love and happiness
Happiness, happiness, money, love and happiness
Happiness, happiness, money, love and happiness

You know what they say about money
That it can't buy happiness
I just need to know

Is this real or just a dream
Hold myself in high esteem
Picky about the little things
Come full circle like a band of wedding rings

Continuing living in the life of lux
Life sometimes, I know it sucks (it's real shitty)
Boy I'm not asking much

People pay me compliments
Boosting up my confidence
All it takes is common sense
All it takes is money, love and happiness

Money, love and happiness
Money, love and happiness
Happiness, happiness, money, love and happiness
Happiness, happiness, money, love and happiness
Happiness, happiness, money, love and happiness

All I gotta say, I wanna be in love
I wanna run away to a place of
Fairy land of dreams, that is where I'll find
Everything I need to have a peace of mind, ow

All it takes is money, love and happiness

Happiness, happiness, money, love and happiness
Happiness, happiness, money, love and happiness
Happiness, happiness, money, love and happiness
Happiness, happiness, money, love and happiness

Money, love and happiness
Money, love and happiness
Money, love and happiness
Money, love... oh





It's a crazy little thing called mad love
It goes something like this

Tangled up in you, uh
Twisted like I've never been before
I don't know what you do
All I know is I want a little more

I don't care if the way that I act doesn't make much sense
When you're near, something in me reacts and there's no defense
I don't mind if everybody's saying that this ain't real
All that matters is how this feels

I'm falling deeper, so fill up my cup
Nothing tastes sweeter than mad love
I know I should, but it's so good, I'm never gonna give it up
'Cause nothing tastes sweeter than mad love
Oh

I wanna take you in (Come here)
A velvet rush is running through mad veins
Like adrenaline, a kiss from you and I'm going so insane
I don't mind if everybody's saying that this ain't real
All that matters is how this feels

I'm falling deeper, so fill up my cup
Nothing tastes sweeter than my love
I know I should, but it's so good, I'm never gonna give it up
'Cause nothing tastes sweeter than mad love

I'm falling deeper, so fill up my cup
Nothing tastes sweeter than mad love
I know I should, but it's so good, I'm never gonna give it up
'Cause nothing tastes sweeter than mad love




[Britney:] Yeah, yeah oh 

Oh I was broken hearted 
Feeling sad and all alone 
I thought I was going crazy, baby 

I thought the pain would last forever 
I thought he'd never ever hurt me, and hurt me 
Over and over again 

Ohh 
When you tried into my world 
You showed the loving ways of how 
A guy should treat a girl 
The love you give that makes me breathe again 

I've found someone who feels me 
An understanding friend till the end 

I know the future no one can see 
But I feel deep in my heart 
You will stay with me eternally 

So just love me 
Even every day 
And hold me in your arms now 
Please love the hurt away 

[FF:] I'll make it go away, yes I will 
[B:] Oh hurt away (ohhh) 

[FF:] I see heaven in your eyes 
Tell me why would he make you cry, and lie 
He must have been out of his mind 

I would never hurt you baby 
Don't let one fool turn you cold (oh no) 
You've got a heart of gold 

[B:] Heart Of gold 
[FF:] I love everything about you 
[B:] All I know is 

[B & FF:] Every word I take it straight to you 
A special part I give for everything I do 

Nobody else comes close to the love you give 
Body and soul 
I'm gonna love you for as long as I live 

[FF:] And I know 
It's not easy letting go (No it's not easy) 
But I won't let you fall 
Together you and me 
We've got it all 

[B:] I just love you 
More and more each day 
I rest my head on your shoulder 
Please love the hurt away 

Love the hurt away 

I know 
I know the future no one can see 
But I feel deep in my heart 
You will stay with me eternally 

[FF:] I just love you 
More and more each day 

[B & FF:] (No, oh) Please love the hurt away (ohh yeah) 
Oh my love 
Love the hurt away (oh oh yeah) 

[B:] Please love the hurt away

You took your love away, too fast
Left no chance to say look back
And now I know the truth,
It makes it easier
Maybe when time goes by,
I’ll understand

Let’s pretend, that I’ve moved on
And I tell myself,
That life goes on, without you.
Open my eyes, Look deep inside.
I run away [x3]

You threw it all away
So blind
You pushed me far from you,
In your life.
Now I know the tears,
Won’t lead to loneliness
Maybe when time goes by,
I’ll understand

Let’s pretend, that I’ve moved on
And I tell myself,
That life goes on, without you.
Open my eyes, Look deep inside.
I run away [x4]

Let’s pretend, that I’ve moved on
And I tell myself,
That life goes on, without you.
Open my eyes, Look deep inside.
I run away [x3]

Let’s pretend, that I’ve moved on
And I tell myself,
That life goes on, without you.
Open my eyes, Look deep inside.
I run away [x3]

Let's pretend, that I've moved on
And I tell myself,
That life goes on, without you.




My mama told me go on and let you go 
Said you would be more problems than I'd ever know 
Said if he's gonna go then let him go away 
But then I get the urge 
It hurts so bad (damn) 
When I feel the thirst 
It makes me mad 
I look up in my bed 
I look up and there is your face 

You love it, you love it 
I'm so hooked on it (hooked on it) 
You want it, you want it 
You're so good 
On a good day 
Sugarfall 
Your sugarfall 
You make my sugarfall (sugarfall) 
You know you want it bad, babe 

I heard it in the streets 
You got another girl 
Yes, it did sting 
But didn't shatter my world (I'm ok) 
You should catch me now 
When I'm in the fall of a state 

You're probably thinking to yourself 
This just aint me 
On the contrary 
I was your freak (I was your freak) 
Hit me one more time 
And trust me I'll be ok 
Hey 

You love it, you love it 
I'm so hooked on it (hooked on it) 
You want it, you want it 
You're so good 
On a good day 
Sugarfall 
Your sugarfall 
You make my sugarfall (sugarfall) 
You know you want it bad, babe 

Now I will be a bad chick 
If I rounded up my clothes 
And headed over straight to the door 
You wouldn't have a clue 
Of what you should do 
If I left you laying longing for more 

You'd be like baby don't go (don't go) 
Baby 
Want some more? 
You want some more? 
Baby don't go (just don't go) 
Said baby please listen 
Don't you just go 

Do you lick your lips? 
When you stand alone 
Well you got no x-ray vision 
Staring through my clothes 
Are you sure that you're prepared 
For what comes serves on its plate 
Wait a minute 
Oooh, I'm having second thoughts 
See my hearts on fault 
Could you pass my shorts? 
Don't you got a girl? 
Till then 
I'm sorry, you must wait 
Especially since I know 

You love it, you love it 
I'm so hooked on it (hooked on it) 
You want it, you want it 
You're so good 
On a good day 
Sugarfall 
Your sugarfall 
You make my sugarfall (sugarfall) 
You know you want it bad, babe 
Hey girl 
I'm so hooked on it (hooked on it) 
You want it, you want it 
You're so good 
On a good day 
Sugarfall 
Your sugarfall 
You make my sugarfall (sugarfall) 
You know you want it bad, babe 
Hey girl 

You know you want it 
So come and get it


Heart, I know I’ve been hard on you
I’m sorry for the things I’ve put you through
Before you start to break on me or ask for sympathy
I need to make you see

Oh, heart, I’m not sure it’s been long enough
To say that what I feel is really love
There’s just one way to learn, sometimes we’ll get hurt
And right now it’s our turn

Give it time, help me through
Heart, we can do this together
You’re my strength, you’re my soul
I need you now more than ever

Heart, all the hurt will soon be gone
If you’ll, if you’ll just keep on being strong
You will always be my friend, so keep on hangin' in
And we’ll find love again

Give it time (Give it time), help me through (Help me through)
Heart, we can do this together
You’re my strength (You’re my strength), you’re my soul
I need you now more than ever

Heart, I know I’ve been hard on you
I’m sorry for the things I put you through
Please don’t you break on me, I need to make you see
It wasn’t meant to be

‘Cause you will always be my friend, so keep on hangin' in
And we’ll find love again


Guilty 

You're always too busy
Why don't you go with me
Don't act like you don't hear me

He noticed no one was with me
I started getting so friendly
He told me I was so pretty
I flirted
I'm guilty

I have no reason to lie
I told you a thousand times
I needed you by my side, but you were nowhere to Ibe found
But you pushed your luck
Now it's all messed up
But you went too far when you broke my heart and I found my guy
And if losing you is what I gotta do to satisfy all my needs
Then I guess that makes me guilty

Guilty Guilty

Stop wondering a thing but
I want you so bad it's danger
It's true I'm nobody's angel
Convict me

The verdict is nothing
He needs me 
Guilty

Tonight you'll cry
Ain't nothing more
That's why deicided to sing this song 'bout

Girls hearts breakin
I was up beatin' and screaming 'n faking
You sit there say I'm filthy when you're the one who made me guilty

Guilty Guilty Guilty Guilty Guilty 

But you pushed your luck

Lying in bed, touching my skin
Oh God I wish you weren't sleeping
I long for your lips, to kiss me again
Don't you know my body's aching?

[Breathe]
Seems we always have a little price to pay,
Price to pay, I'm Falling in love
It all starts, starts to fade

Footsteps in the rain, memories wash away
Beyond the headlight glare, it's kind of dark out there
And everywhere I've been, it's hard to find a friend
I've got no alibis for the state I'm in

Everybody needs, needs a place to go
God know's I have seen it's a twisting, winding road

Every day, the sun comes up again
A little hope begins and it starts with you 'cause you get me through it
And every day, I'm closer to the shore, I smile a little more
And because of your faith, I get closer now every day

Said every day, I said every day, every day

It's hard to recognize, across the great divide
Just what you left behind and what you keep inside
A ripple in the calm, you keep my safe from harm
Somehow you still believe, you believe in me
Where it starts and ends, only time must know
Wherever you will be is where I wanna go

Every day, the sun comes up again
A little hope begins and it starts with you 'cause you get me through it
And every day, I'm closer to the shore, I smile a little more
And because of your faith, I get closer now every day

'Cause you set me free
'Cause you set me free

And every day, the sun comes up again
A little hope begins and it starts with you 'cause you get me through it
And every day, I'm closer to the shore, I smile a little more
And because of your faith, I get closer now every day


I know I may be young, but I've got feelings too. 
And I need to do what I feel like doing. 
So let me go and just listen. 

All you people look at me like I'm a little girl. 
Well did you ever think it be okay for me to step into this world. 

Always saying little girl don't step into the club. 
Well I'm just tryin' to find out why cause dancing's what I love. 

Get it get it, get it get it (WHOOOA) 
Get it get it, get it get it (WHOOOOOA) (Do you like it) 
Get it get it, get it get it (OOOHHHH) (This feels good) 

I know I may come off quiet, I may come off shy. 
But I feel like talking, feel like dancing when I see this guy. 

What's practical is logical. What the hell, who cares? 
All I know is I'm so happy when you're dancing there. 

I'm a slave for you. I cannot hold it; I cannot control it. 
I'm a slave for you. I won't deny it; I'm not trying to hide it. 

Baby, don't you wanna, dance upon me, 
(I just wanna dance next to you) 
To another time and place. 
Baby, don't you wanna, dance upon me, 
(Are you ready) 
Leaving behind my name, my age. 
(Lets go) 

(Like that) 
(You like it) 
(Now watch me) 

Get it get it, get it get it (WHOOOA) 
Get it get it, get it get it (WHOOOOOA) 
Get it get it, get it get it (OOOHHHH) 
(Panting) 

I really wanna dance, tonight with you. 
(I just can't help myself) 
I really wanna do what you want me to. 
(I just feel I let myself go) 

I really wanna dance, tonight with you. 
(Wanna see you move) 
I really wanna do what you want me to. 
(Uh Uh Uh) 

Baby, don't you wanna, dance upon me, 
(I just wanna dance next to you) 
To another time and place. 
Baby, don't you wanna, dance upon me, 
(Are you ready) 
Leaving behind my name, my age. 

I'm a slave for you. (Take that) I cannot hold it; I cannot control it. 
I'm a slave (It just feels right) for you. (It just feels good) 
I won't deny it; I'm not trying to hide it. (Baby) 

Get it get it, get it get it (WHOOOA) 
Get it get it, get it get it (WHOOOOOA)

I cannot hold it; I cannot control it. 
I'm a slave for you. (Here we go) I won't deny it, (Yeah) 
I'm not trying to hide it. 


Lying alone 
Touching my skin 
I'm falling under 
A girl like me 
And I can't hold it in 
It makes me wonder 

Is this for real? 
It's not what it seems 
You're like an angel 
I'm running now 
My feet off the ground 

[Pre-chorus:]
Take me 
Touch me 
Won't you hold me close? 

[Chorus:]
And then we kiss 
Your love comes alive on my lips 
I feel a rush 
Coming over me, over me 
And when we touch 
This moment when everything's still 
I close my eyes 
And then we kiss 

The feel of your hand 
As it touches my hair 
It makes me tremble 
Don't wanna let go 
Of the feelings we share 
So baby, go slow 

Our hearts beating fast 
And my body cries 
I want it to last 
It's burning inside 
We're getting deeper 

[Pre-chorus x1]
[Chorus x1]

You're drifting 
The sun comes up 
You're fading 
You seem so far 
I don't know 
If I'm awake 
Open my eyes 
And then ww 
We kiss... 

[Pre-chorus x1]
[Chorus x1]

And then we kiss 
And then we kiss 
And when we touch 
This moment when everything's still 
I close my eyes 
And then we kiss


Come notice me 
And take my hand 
So why are we 
Strangers when 
Our love is strong 
Why carry on without me? 
And everytime I try to fly 
I fall without my wings 
I feel so small 
I guess I need you baby 
And everytime I see you in my dreams 
I see your face, it's haunting me 
I guess I need you baby 
I make believe 
That you are here 
It's the only way 
I see clear 
What have I done 
You seem to move on easy 
And everytime I try to fly 
I fall without my wings 
I feel so small 
I guess I need you baby 
And everytime I see you in my dreams 
I see your face, you're haunting me 
I guess I need you baby 
I may have made it rain 
Please forgive me 
My weakness caused you pain 
And this song is my sorry 
Ohhhh 
At night I pray 
That soon your face 
Will fade away 
And everytime I try to fly 
I fall without my wings 
I feel so small 
I guess I need you baby 
And everytime I see you in my dreams 
I see your face, you're haunting me 
I guess I need you baby


Early mornin' 
All right, I was out real late last night 
Got a little messy 
Early morning 
Can't be like that anymore, oh 

I was shaking my ass in the streets this morning 
Just walked in and it's early morning 
Got drunk till the break of dawning 
It don't stop till the early morning 
Passed out on the couch I'm yawning 
Just walked in and it's early morning 
Got drunk till the break of dawning 
It don't stop till the early morning 

Wanna talk to 
When he walked up someone grabbed him 
But I liked him to come here 
Kinda cool 
Baby, we can make plans 
Where ya live 
Does your mama live there 
We can hook up at the hotel 
Hands down so 
I told him, let's go 
But have a next guess 
But you don't wanna know 

I was shaking my ass in the streets this morning 
Just walked in and it's early morning 
Got drunk till the break of dawning 
It don't stop till the early morning 
Passed out on the couch I'm yawning 
Just walked in and it's early morning 
Got drunk till the break of dawning 
It don't stop till the early morning 

Oh, in love 
So I approached him 
We gotta give him his friends 
There's something 'bout him that show 
So I said, what the hell 
Let's go 
Got up, got on the dance floor 
Hooked up with a guy named Joe 
When the music was fast and slow 
But have a next guess 
But you don't wanna know 

I was shaking my ass in the streets this morning 
Just walked in and it's early morning 
Got drunk till the break of dawning 
It don't stop till the early morning 
Passed out on the couch I'm yawning 
Just walked in and it's early morning 
Got drunk till the break of dawning 
It don't stop till the early morning 

Call all your boys 
Call all your girls 
Call all your friends 
Let's do it again 
Let's do it again 

Yes, early morning 
Yes, can't keep doin' this 

I light your fire 
Your one desire 
Pull on me, baby 
And I'll take you higher 
You should try her 
So come over here and let's go so 

I was shaking my ass in the streets this morning 
Just walked in and it's early morning 
Got drunk till the break of dawning 
It don't stop till the early morning 
Passed out on the couch I'm yawning 
Just walked in and it's early morning 
Got drunk till the break of dawning 
It don't stop till the early morning 

Call all your boys 
Call all your girls 
Call all your friends 
Let's do it again 
Let's do it 

Early mornin', early mornin'



Nothin` seems to be the way 
That it used to 
Everything seems shallow 
God give me truth, In me 
and tell me somebody`s watching 
Over me 
And that is all I pray is that 

Someday I will understand 
In God`s whole plan 
And what`s He`s done to me 
Oh but maybe 
Someday I will breathe 
And I`ll finally see 
See it all in my baby 

Don`t you run too fast my dear 
Why don`t you stop 
Just stop and listen to your tears 
They`re all you`ve got 

It`s in you 
You see somebody`s watching 
Over You 
And that is all I pray is that 

Someday you will understand 
In God`s whole plan 
And what he does to you 
Oh but baby 
Someday you will breathe 
And you`ll finally see 
You`ll see it all in your baby 
You`ll see it all in your baby 

No moment will be more true 
Than the moment 
I look at you 

It`s in you It's Britney Bitch
I see you,
And i just wanna dance with you

Everytime they turn the lights down
Just wanna go that extra mile for you
You got my display of affection
Feels like no one else in the room (but you)

[Bridge:]
We can get down like there's no one around
We keep on rocking, we keep on rockin'
Cameras are flashing while we're dirty dancing
They keep watching, keep watchin'
Feels like the the crowd was saying

[Chorus:]
Gimme Gimme more
Gimme more
Gimme gimme more [x4]

The center of attention, even when we're up against the wall
You got me in a crazy position (uh huh)
If you're on a mission (ooh)
You got my permission oh

[Bridge]

[Chorus (x4)]

[Spoken]
I just can't control myself, more
They want more?
Well I'll give them more (ow!)

[Chorus (x4)]

Gimme more gimme more
Gimme more gimme more babe
I just want more

Gimme gimme gimme gimme gimme 
Gimme gimme gimme gimme gimme 
Gimme gimme gimme gimme gimme 
Gimme gimme gimme gimme gimme 

I'm Miss American Dream since I was 17
Don't matter if I step on the scene
Or sneak away to the Philippines
They're still gonna put pictures of my derriere in the magazine
You want a piece of me?
You want a piece of me...

I'm Miss bad media karma
Another day another drama
Guess I can't see the harm
In working and being a mama
And with a kid on my arm
I'm still an exceptional earner
And you want a piece of me

I'm Mrs. Lifestyles of the rich and famous
(You want a piece of me)
I'm Mrs. Oh my God that Britney's Shameless
(You want a piece of me)
I'm Mrs. Extra! Extra! this just in
(You want a piece of me)
I'm Mrs. she's too big now she's too thin
(You want a piece of me)

I'm Mrs. 'You want a piece of me?'
Tryin' and pissin' me off
Well get in line with the paparazzi
Who's flippin' me off
Hopin' I'll resort to some havoc
And end up settlin' in court
Now are you sure you want a piece of me? (you want a piece of me)
I'm Mrs. 'Most likely to get on the TV for strippin' on the streets'
When getting the groceries, no, for real..
Are you kidding me?
No wonder there's panic in this industry
I mean please...
Do you want a piece of me?

I'm Mrs. Lifestyles of the rich and famous
(You want a piece of me)
I'm Mrs. Oh my God that Britney's Shameless
(You want a piece of me)
I'm Mrs. Extra! Extra! this just in
(You want a piece of me)
I'm Mrs. she's too big now she's too thin
(You want a piece of me)
I'm Miss American Dream since I was 17
Don't matter if I step on the scene
Or sneak away to the Philippines
They're still gonna put pictures of my derriere in the magazine
You want a piece of me?
You want a piece of me...
You want a piece of me?
I'm Mrs. Lifestyles of the rich and famous
(You want a piece of me)
I'm Mrs. Oh my God that Britney's Shameless
(You want a piece of me)
I'm Mrs. Extra! Extra! this just in

You see somebody`s watching 
over you 
and that is all I pray is that 

Someday you will understand 
In God`s whole plan 
And what He does to you 
Oh but maybe 
Someday you will breathe 
And you`ll finally see 
You`ll see it all in your baby 
You`ll see it all in your baby 

You`ll see it all in your baby 
You`ll see it all in your baby...


It's been a while
I know I shouldn't have kept you waiting
But I'm here now

I know it's been a while
But I'm glad you came
And I've been thinking 'bout
How you say my name
You got my body spinning
Like a hurricane
And it feels like
You got me going insane
And I can't get enough
So let me get it up

Ooh, looks like we're alone now
You ain't gotta be scared
We're grown now
I'm a hit defrost on you
Let's get it blazin'
We can turn the heat up if you wanna
Turn the lights down low if you wanna
Just wanna move you
But you're frozen
That's what I'm saying

Let me break the ice
Allow me to get you right
Let you warm up to me
Baby I can make you feel
Let me break the ice
Allow me to get you right
Let you warm up to me
Baby I can make you feel

So are you warming up yet?

You got me hypnotised
I never felt this way
You got my heart beating like an 808
Can you rise to the occasion?
I'm patiently waiting
Cause it's getting late
And I can't get enough
So let me get it up

Ooh, looks like we're alone now
You ain't gotta be scared
We're grown now
I'm a hit defrost on you
Let's get it blazin'
We can turn the heat up if you wanna
Turn the lights down low if you wanna
Just wanna move you
But you're frozen
That's what I'm saying

Let me break the ice
Allow me to get you right
Let you warm up to me
Baby I can make you feel
Let me break the ice
Allow me to get you right
Let you warm up to me
Baby I can make you feel

I like this part
It feels kinda good
Yeah

Let me break the ice
Allow me to get you right
Let you warm up to me
Baby I can make you feel
Let me break the ice
Allow me to get you right
Let you warm up to me
Baby I can make you feel
Hot (more)



Your touch
Your taste
Your breath
Your face
Your hands
Your head
You're sweet
Your love
Your teeth
Your tongue
Your eye
You're mine
Your lips
You're fine
You're heaven on earth

I've waited all my life for you
My favourite kiss
Your perfect skin
Your perfect smile

Waking up and you're next to me
Wrap me up in your arms and back to sleep
Lay my head on your chest and drift away
Dream of you and I'm almost half awake

(The palest green I've never seen
The colour of your eyes
You've taken me so far away
One look and you stop time)

Fell in love with you and
Everything that you are
Nothing I can do I'm really
Crazy about you
When you're next to me

It's just like heaven on earth
You're heaven
You're heaven on earth

Tell me that I'll always be the one that you want
Don't know what I'd do if I ever lose you
Look at you and what I see is heaven on earth
I'm in love with you

Your breath
Your face
Your hands
Your head
You're sweet
Your love
Your tongue

I'd move across the world for you
Just tell me when
Just tell me where
I'll come to you

Take me back to that place in time
Images of you occupy my mind
Far away but I feel you hear with me
Dream of you and you're almost next to me

(The palest green I've never seen
The colour of your eyes
You've taken me so far away
One look and you stop time)

Fell in love with you and
Everything that you are
Nothing I can do I'm really
Crazy about you
When you're next to me
It's just like heaven on earth
You're heaven
You're heaven on earth

Tell me that I'll always be the one that you want
Don't know what I'd do if I ever lose you
Look at you and what I see is heaven on earth
I'm in love with you

I'm in love with you
I said I'm so in love
I said I'm so in love
So in love

Fall off the edge of my mind
I fall off the edge of my mind
For you
I fall off the edge of my mind
I fall off the edge of my mind
For you

Fell in love with you and
Everything that you are
Nothing I can do I'm really
Crazy about you
When you're next to me
It's just like heaven on earth
(So in love)
You're heaven
You're heaven on earth

Tell me that I'll always be the one that you want
Don't know what I'd do if I ever lose you
Look at you and what I see is heaven on earth
I'm in love with you

I'm so in love
I'm so in love

I fall off the edge of my mind
(I'm so in love)
When I just look at you
I feel like I'm gonna jump into heaven
(So in love)
And you'll catch me
Catch me if I jump
Will you catch me?

Like I'm in a race and I'm jumping the hurdle
Come closer we'll pursue it
Baby Just let go we can do it

Baby I'm just hot for taking
Don't you wanna see my body naked
And I bet you like the way I shake it
And I hope that you can take it

[Chorus:]
You're the perfect lover

So seductive when you touch me

Better hurry up
Cause time is ticking
Tic Tock Tic Tock
Come and Get me while I'm hot

[Chorus]

[x2]
Pull up to my bumper
Need a jump, not a chump
Fill me up, I'm running low
Let me drive you crazy
All night cause we got so far to go



They couldn't believe I did it
But I was so committed
My life was so restricted for you
I just dove inside it blind
Couldn't see what swam inside
Thought that'd be romantic for you

Exchanged my vows
And said it all
Woman, let's prepare to fall
Even, screaming did it for you
(Remember?)

My friends said you would play me
But I just said they're crazy
While I was crying, praying
Was it true?

Why should I be sad?
Heaven knows
From the stupid freaking things that you do
(Stupid freaking things)
Why should I get mad? Feel sad?
Who knows?
Just take it all
As a sign that we're through
Goodbye

It's time for me to move along
(Goodbye)
It's time for me to get it on
(OK)
I'm tired of singing sad songs
(All right)
It's time for me
(Britney, let's go)

I sent you to Vegas
With a pocket full of paper
And with no ultimatums on you
I thought what could separate us
But it just seemed that Vegas
Only brought the player outta you
(Hey baby, what's your name?)

Lavish homes and fancy cars
Even got the drop Ferrari
Filled up our garage for you
Made your choice with all the teams
People and US Magazines
Tell me who'd I do that for, who?

Why should I be sad?
Heaven knows
From the stupid freaking things that you do
(Stupid freaking things)
Why should I get mad? Feel sad?
Who knows?
Just take it all
As a sign that we're through
Goodbye

It's time for me to move along
(Goodbye)
It's time for me to get it on
(OK)
I'm tired of singing sad songs
(All right)
It's time for me
(Britney, let's go)

It's time for me to move along
(Goodbye)
It's time for me to get it on
(OK)
I'm tired of singing sad songs
(All right)
It's time for me
(Britney, let's go)

And don't you worry
About our angels
(All the magazines trying to intervene
Seeing things in the gossip section)
There'll get good guidance
And be trained well
Don't worry I'll keep a little secret
When I ask this question

Why should I be sad?
Heaven knows
From the stupid freaking things that you do
(Stupid freaking things)
Why should I get mad? Feel sad?
Who knows?
Just take it all
As a sign that we're through
Goodbye

It's time for me to move along
(Goodbye)
It's time for me to get it on
(OK)
I'm tired of singing sad songs
(All right)
It's time for me
(Britney, let's go)

It's time for me to move along
(Goodbye)
It's time for me to get it on
(OK)
I'm tired of singing sad songs
(All right)
It's time for me
(Britney, let's go)

Yeah
Baby, come on


I know you hear me on your radio
Well here we go
Please turn up your radio
Wanna tell you somethin
Hear me on your radio
Well here we go
Please turn up your radio
Wanna tell you somethin

There was a time
I used to think
That love would never turn into reality
I never thought
I'd find the one
But I tell I'm drawn to you a strength of none

You must be from heaven, baby, yes you are
Your love is like a shooting star
So they can try but they can't touch (touch)
You gotta look up to us

[Chorus:]
'cause your love is outta this world (oh)
And you bring me down to earth
I love how you put me first (oh)
Make me feel my every word
'cause I'm saying, you know this is about you
I keep saying you know this is about you
It must be
This is about you
I never felt this way
I know this be a song about you
Forever, everyday
I know this be a song about you

I'll be your moon
I'll make it bright
And when it's dark I promise that you'll see the light
And just as far as the moon from the summer sun
That's how long that I'll be here
And it's because

You must be from heaven, baby, yes you are
Your love is like a shooting star
So they can try but they can't touch
You gotta look up to us

[Chorus]

In my sky
We're the stars
I'm on Venus
You're on Mars
People can't understand
How I'm your girl and you're my man

In my sky

So precocious
Assuming that your into me
So fierce the way
You pierce me with your energy
My heart's on fire
Boy come on and rescue me

When I see you

There's only two types of people in the world
The ones that entertain, and the ones that observe
Well baby I'm a put-on-a-show kinda girl
Don't like the backseat, gotta be first (oh, oh)

I'm like the ringleader
I call the shots (call the shots)
I'm like a firecracker
I make it hot
When I put on a show

[Bridge:]
I feel the adrenaline moving through my veins (hah, hah, hah)
Spotlight on me and I'm ready to break (hah, hah, hah)
I'm like a performer, the dancefloor is my stage (hah, hah, hah)
Better be ready, hope that ya feel the same (hah, hah, hah)

[Chorus:]
All the eyes on me in the center of the ring
Just like a circus (ah, ah, ahaha-hah)
When I crack that whip, everybody gonna trip
Just like a circus (ah, ah, ahaha-hah)
Don't stand there watching me, follow me
Show me what you can do
Everybody let go, we can make a dancefloor
Just like a circus (ah, ah, ahaha-hah, ha, ha, ha, ha, ho, ho, ho)

[VERSE 2]
There's only two types of guys out there,
Ones that can hang with me, and ones that are scared
So baby I hope that you came prepared
I run a tight ship, so beware

I'm like a ring leader,
I call the shots (call the shots)
I'm like a fire cracker,
I make it hot
When I put on a show.

[Bridge]

[Chorus]

Let's go..(ah, ah, ahaha-hah)
Let me see what you can do..(ah, ah, ahaha-hah)
I'm running this.
Yeah, like what..?

[Chorus:]
All the eyes on me in the center of the ring
Just like a circus (ah, ah, ahaha-hah)
When I crack that whip, everybody gonna trip
Just like a circus (ah, ah, ahaha-hah)
Don't stand there watching me, follow me
Show me what you can do
Everybody let go, we can make a dancefloor
Just like a circus (ah, ah, ahaha-hah)
All the eyes on me in the center of the ring
Just like a circus (ah, ah, ahaha-hah)
When I crack that whip, everybody gonna trip
Just like a circus (ah, ah, ahaha-hah)
Don't stand there watching me, follow me
Show me what you can do
Everybody let go, we can make a dancefloor
Just like a circus (ah, ah, ahaha-hah, ha, ha, ha, ha, ho, ho, ho)


Breath you out
Breath you in
You keep coming back to tell me
You're the one who could have been
And my eyes see it all so clear
It was long ago and far away but it never disappears
I try to put it in the past
Hold on to myself and don't look back

I don't wanna dream about
All the things that never were
Maybe I can live without
When I'm out from under
I don't wanna feel the pain
What good would it do me now
I'll get it all figured out
When I'm out from under

So let me go
Just let me fly away
Let me feel the space between us growing deeper
And much darker every day
Watch me now and I'll be someone new
My heart will be unbroken
It will open up for everyone but you
Even when I cross the line
It's like a lie I've told a thousand times

I don't wanna dream about
All the things that never were
Maybe I can live without
When I'm out from under
I don't wanna feel the pain
What good would it do me now
I'll get it all figured out
When I'm out from under

And part of me still believes
When you say you're gonna stick around
And part of me still believes
We can find a way to work it out
But I know that we tried everything we could try
So let's just say goodbye
Forever

I don't wanna dream about
All the things that never were
Maybe I can live without
When I'm out from under
I don't wanna feel the pain
What good would it do me now
I'll get it all figured out
When I'm out from under

I don't wanna dream about
All the things that never were
Maybe I can live without
When I'm out from under
I don't wanna feel the pain
What good would it do me now
I'll get it all figured out
When I'm out from under

When I'm out from under

Eff me over, your exposure

Oh, oh, oh, oo-oo-oo-oo-oh
Oh, oh, oh, oo-oo-oo-oo-oh

Did I wake you?
Were you sleeping?
Were you still in the bed?

Or is a nightmare keeping you up instead?
Ooh baby, are you feeling guilty for what you did?
If you think you're hurting, you ain't seen nothing yet

[Refrain:]
Was it really worth it?
Was she everything that you were lookin for?
Feel like a man?
I hope you know that you can't come back
Cause all we had is broken like shattered glass

[Chorus:]
You're gonna see me in your dreams tonight
My face is gonna haunt you all the time
I promise that you gon' want me back
When your world falls apart like shattered glass
Glass, glass, glass

Are you having trouble focusing throughout the day?
Do you find yourself still callin' my name?
Do you wish you could rewind time and take it back?
I bet you realize that she ain't half the woman I am

[Refrain]

[Chorus]

Glass (gl-gl-gl), glass (glee-glee-glee), glass, glass

Oh, oh, oh, oo-oo-oo-oo-oh
Oh, oh, oh, oo-oo-oo-ooh


Lalalalala

Oh baby baby
Have you seen Amy tonight?
Is she in the bathroom
Is she smokin' up outside
Oh

Oh baby baby
Does she take a piece of lime
For the drink that I'm gonna buy her
Do you know just what she likes
Oh

[Refrain:]
Oh Oh
Tell me have you seen her
Because I'm so
Oh
I can't get her off of my brain
I just want to go to the party she gonna go
Can somebody take me home
Ha ha he ha ha ho

[Chorus]
Love me hate me
Say what you want about me
But all of the boys and all of the girls are
begging to If You Seek Amy
Love me hate me
But can't you see what I see
All of the boys and all of the girls
are begging to If You Seek Amy

Lalalalalala

Amy told me that she's gonna meet me up
I don't know where or when and now they're closing up the club
Oh

I've seen her once or twice before she knows my face
But it's hard to see with all the people standing in the way
Oh

[Refrain]

[Chorus]

[Bridge:]
Oh
Say what you want about me
Oh
But can't you see what I see
Oh
Say what you want about me

So tell me if you see her
Let me know what she was wearing and what she was like
Cause I have been waiting here forever
Let me know when she going out
Oh baby baby
If You Seek Amy tonight
Oh
Oh baby baby
We'll do whatever you like
Oh baby baby baby
Oh baby baby baby

Lalalalalala
Lalalalalala

[Chorus]

[Bridge]

All of the boys and all of the girls are
begging to If You Seek Amy


Nothin' about you is typical
Nothin' about you's predictable
You got me all twisted and confused
(It's so you)
Up 'til now, I thought I knew love
Nothin' to lose and it's damaged 'cause
Pattern to fall as quick as I do
(But now)

Bridges are burnin'
Baby, I'm learnin'
A new way of thinking now
Love, I can see
Nothing will be
Just like it was
Is that because

Baby, you're so unusual
Didn't anyone tell you you're s'posed to 
Break my heart, I expect you to
So why haven't you?
Maybe you're not even human 'cause
Only an angel could be so unusual
Sweet surprise I could get used to
Unusual you

Ah-ah, ah ah
Ah-ah, ah ah
Ah-ah, ah ah
Ah-ah, ah ah

Been so many things when I was someone else
Boxer in the ring, tryin' to defend myself
And the private eye to see what's goin' on
(That's long gone)
When I'm with you, I can just be myself
You're always where you say you will be
Shocking, 'cause I never knew love like this
Could exist

Tables are turnin'
My heart is soarin'
You'll never let me down
Answer my call
Here after all
Never met anyone
Like you

Baby, you're so unusual
Didn't anyone tell you you're s'posed to 
Break my heart, I expect you to
So why haven't you?
Maybe you're not even human 'cause
Only an angel could be so unusual
Sweet surprise I could get used to
Unusual you

Ah-ah, ah ah
Ah-ah, ah ah
Ah-ah, ah ah
Ah-ah, ah ah

Can't believe that I
Almost didn't try
When you called my name
Now everything is changed

Baby, you're so unusual
Didn't anyone tell you you're s'posed to 
Break my heart, I expect you to
So why haven't you?
Maybe you're not even human 'cause
Only an angel could be so unusual
Sweet surprise I could get used to
Unusual you

Ah-ah, ah ah
Ah-ah, ah ah
Ah-ah, ah ah
Ah-ah, ah ah


Turn the lights out 
This shit is way too fucking bright 
Wanna poke my eyes out 
If you wanna mess with my eyesight 
Just let me get my head right 
Where the hell am I? 
Who are you? 
What'd we do 
Last night? 
Hey yeah yeah 
Who are you? 
What'd we do 
Last night? 
Hey yeah yeah 

Can't remember what I did last night 
Maybe I shouldn't have given in 
But I just couldn't fight 
Hope I didn't but I think I might've 
Everything, everything is still a blur 
Can't remember what I did last night 
Everything, everything is still a blur (Did last night) 
Can't remember what I did last night 
Everything, everything is still a blur 
What's your name, man? 

Can you calmly hand me all my things? 
I think I need an aspirin 
Better yet, I need to get up outta here 
I gotta get my head right 
Where the hell am I? 
Who are you? 
What'd we do 
Last night? 
Yeah yeah yeah 

Can't remember what I did last night 
Maybe I shouldn't have given in 
But I just couldn't fight 
Hope I didn't but I think I might've 
Everything, everything is still a blur 
Can't remember what I did last night 
Everything, everything is still a blur (Did last night) 
Can't remember what I did last night 
Everything, everything is still a blur 

What happened last night? 
'Cause I don't-- 'cause I don't remember 
What happened? 

Can't remember what I did last night 
Maybe I shouldn't have given in 
But I just couldn't fight 
Hope I didn't but I think I might've 
Everything, everything is still a blur 
Can't remember what I did last night (Blur) 
Everything, everything is still a blur (Did last night) 
Can't remember what I did last night 
Everything, everything is still a blur

Loose guys, on my backless, dresses, excess.

I cannot help myself, I'm just doing what I do,
Help myself to anything that I want so thank you,
I like it and I do what I like,
And then you do what I like, and you like it

[Chorus:]
If you wanna just
Scream,
Scream your lungs out,
If you wanna just

Cry your eyes out,

That's what I'm about.

You can cry your eyes out of your head,
Baby, baby,
I don't care, I don't care,

You can cry(-cry-cry) again(-gain-gain),
My face like a mannequin,

Mannequin, yea I did,
It again and again,
You can cry(-cry-cry) again(-gain-gain),
My face like a mannequin.

You told me you're lonely, 
Can't hear you,

There's no way you want me,
Watch me, dress me
Can't impress me,
I'm not changing, I'm just...

French finger tips, red lips, bitch is dangerous
Cotton candy kiss, can't wait for my sugar rush

Can't take it no more,
I've got to have more tonight (tonight)
This feeling so strong, I'm puttin' you on tonight
Alright, let's go...

[Chorus:]
Baby take a seat, eyes on me, this is my show
Your one and only pleasure
All decked in lace and leather
Fantasy, courtesy... on me, baby let's go
Watch me apply the pressure
All decked in lace and leather

Heels 6-inch, makes a boy want to bite his lip
Look but don't touch, unless you want to loose your innocence

Can't take it no more
I've got to have more tonight
Night, night, night, night, night, night, night, night, night
This feeling so strong, I'm puttin' you on tonight
Night, night, night, night, night, night...
Let's go...

Leather, leather, leather, leather, leather

Tiny hands.
Yes, that's you.
And all you show,
It's simply true.
I smell your breathe,
it makes me cry.
I wonder how,
I've lived my life.

[Chorus]
Cause without you,
How did I get through,
All of my days,
Without you?
Now living with you,
See everything's true,
My baby, it's you.
My baby.
My baby,
My baby.

With no words at all,
So tiny and small.
In love I fall,
So deep.
So deep.

My precious love,
Sent from above.
My baby boo,
God I thank you.
God I thank you.

If you come over we can fly away
Together, let's go

Take me down and you hold me right
Spin me all around,
I feel so dizzy, I fall into you
You rock me, you rock me, you rock me in

Can ya hold me tight and don't let go?

Double time now, so get in line

My world is spinnin' round you,
Don't wanna let you down
I'm lost when you're around me,
Take me so far away from here

Look how I'm spinnin' round you,
Don't wanna let you down
I'm lost and can't be found now
Take me down, take me down

If you come over we can fly away
Together, let's go

[Chorus]

Rock me in,
You rock me in

Rock me in,
You rock me in

Rock me in,
You rock me in




We're not so different
You and me
'Cause we both
Share our share of obscenities
And everybody's
Got some freaky tendencies
Hidden or admitted
'Cause we all got needs

And I make no apologies (Huh-huh)
I'm into phonography (Huh-huh)
And I like my bluetooth, buttons comin' loose
I need my hands free (Huh-huh)
Then I let my mind roam (Huh-huh)
Playin' with my ringtone
He got service, I've got service
Baby, we can talk all night (Go)

Let's talk about biology
Make believe you're next to me
Phonography, phonography
Talk that sexy talk to me
Better make sure that the line is green
Keep it confidential, you and me
Phonography, phonography
Dirty talk and call it phonography (Hey!)

I can follow
All your commands
But there will be no talk of
Adding you to my plan
I'll keep you connected
Long as you understand
That's how we should keep it
Mr. Telephone Man

And I make no apologies (Huh-huh)
I'm into phonography (Huh-huh)
And I like my bluetooth, buttons comin' loose
I need my hands free (Huh-huh)
Then I let my mind roam (Huh-huh)
Playin' with my ringtone
He got service, I've got service
Baby, we can talk all night (Go)

Let's talk about biology
Make believe you're next to me
Phonography, phonography
Talk that sexy talk to me
Better make sure that the line is green
Keep it confidential, you and me
Phonography, phonography
Dirty talk and call it phonography (Hey!)

Baby, if you're not alone
Take me off speakerphone
What I'm 'bout to say right here
Is just for your ears to hear
If you need to
Hit me back, hit me back
I got a star 69
For that shit, for that shit (Go)

Let's talk about biology
Make believe you're next to me
Phonography, phonography
Talk that sexy talk to me
Better make sure that the line is green
Keep it confidential, you and me
Phonography, phonography
Dirty talk and call it phonography (Hey!)

I still see your coast hangin' on the door,
Never let anybody put one there before
My pillow's got your head printed on it
Baby, of all the guys you were my favorite

Don't ask, me why
I just can't say goodbye
No not, tonight
No, I just can't say it

[Chorus:]
'Cause I'm gonna hold on
Yeah, I'm gonna hold on
Baby, gotta keep holdin' on to what we had
'Cause I don't wanna move on
So I gotta hold on
Baby because you and me are sinking like quicksand
Like quicksand, like quicksand
Baby because you and me are sinking like quicksand
Like quicksand, baby like quicksand
Baby because you and me are sinking like quicksand

You came along I didn't know of love
But now I know that sometimes it's just not enough
I hear your footsteps in my corridoor
But it is just my heart, it's pounding like before

Wish I, could try
But I just can't say goodbye
No not, tonight
No, I just can't say it

[Chorus]

'Cause the ground is breaking,
I can feel it shaking
Wish it was that easy,
But it's not that easy
Gotta hold my hands up,
Gotta keep my head up
Gotta keep on breathing,
Baby even if we're sinking
Even if we're sinking
Baby even if we're sinking
Even if we are sinking

'Cause I just-just gotta-gotta hold (Hold)

[Chorus]

Only got one life to live,
We don't even need a piece of sand
Only you and me,
We need to hold on and hold on and...

Only got one life to live,
We don't even need a piece of sand
Only you and me,
We need to hold on and hold on and hold on
And hold on
And hold on, and hold on

And hold on, and hold on, and hold on
And hold on, and hold on, and hold on
And hold on, and hold on, and hold on



I saw him standin' there
In the parkin' lot
He asked if I
Came here a lot
And this is how
I responded

[Chorus:]
I forgot my name
I forgot my telephone number
If he wanna see me
He don't even know it
I forgot my address
Damsel in distress
I forgot my boyfriend
Was the one that had bought me this bra

[Chorus 2:]
I get amnesia
When I'm standin' next to you-ou-ou
He's been with me for several years
I know this much is true
Didn't know it was over
'Til you came on over
And told me that you just, just can't
Forget about me

I talk to my girls
I can talk to my girls like crazy
To anyone, I speak my mind
I tell them mother don't phase me
I'm not lazy
But boy, lately
When I see you, I stu-utter
Watch you slip away like butterflies

I saw you standin' there
In the VIP on Friday
We conversate up in my
Fantasies like, every day
But I'm a dud
Whenever you approach
Like yesterday when you just
Came to say hello

[Chorus]

[Chorus 2]

Me
Me
This is how I do

I talk to most guys
I can talk to most guys like crazy
To anyone, I'll speak my mind
I tell them mother don't phase me
But you shake me
Boy, you make me
St-o-o-o-op and stutter
When we touch, I melt like butter

I saw you standin' there
In the VIP on Saturday
Now that I know you got a
Thing for me, I should be straight
Not the kinda girl who'll just let
Any guy get close
I like him so I'm gon' tell my guy
He should just effin' go


Me
Me
This is how I do
 

Watch me,
(Watch me, watch me, watch me,
Watch me, watch me, watch me,
Watch me, watch me, watch me,
Watch me, watch me, watch me,
Watch me, watch me...)

You can cry your eyes out of your head,
Baby, baby,
I don't care, I don't care,
I don't care, I don't care,
You can cry(-cry-cry) again(-gain-gain),
My face like a mannequin,

Mannequin, yea I did,
It again and again,
You can cry(-cry-cry) again(-gain-gain),

My face like a mannequin 
My face like a mannequin 
My face like a mannequin 
My face like a mannequin 
My face like a mannequin 
My face like a mannequin 
My face like a mannequin 





You and I left alone, cannot be trusted
There's a lust, we can't control
Slowly undress, chest to chest
And unless I say goodnight
I know we're only gonna move too far
Please, I'm not quite ready for that next level
One kiss and that spells trouble

Next day I'll snatch the goods away

You're not quite there, you're not on my level
Trust me for you, I'm trouble

You could talk me in, talk me into it
If you wanted to do
You could talk me in, talk me into it
If you only knew

[Bridge:]
See the sunlight, we ain't stopping
Keep on dancing till the world ends
If you feel it let it happen
Keep on dancing till the world ends


Hey, over there
Please, forgive me
If I'm comin' on too strong
Hate to stare
But, you're winnin'
And they're playin' my favorite song
So, come here
A little closer
Wanna whisper in your ear
Make it clear
A little question
Wanna know just how you feel

[Chorus]
If I said my heart was beating loud
If we could escape the crowd somehow
If I said I want your body now
Would you hold it against me?
'Cause, you feel like paradise
And I need a vacation tonight
So, if I said I want your body now
Would you hold it against me?

[Verse 2]
Hey, you might think
That I'm crazy
But, you know I'm just your type
I might be
A little hazy
But, you just cannot deny
There's a spark
In between us
When we're dancin' on the floor
I want more
Wanna see it
So, I'm askin' you tonight

[Chorus]
If I said my heart was beating loud
If we could escape the crowd somehow
If I said I want your body now
Would you hold it against me?
'Cause, you feel like paradise
And I need a vacation tonight
So, if I said I want your body now
Would you hold it against me?

If I said I want your body
Would you hold it against me?

Yeah
Uh-huh
Oh

[Bridge]
Give me somethin' good
Don't wanna wait
I want it now
Pop it like a hood
And show me how you work it out

Alright

If I said my heart was beating loud

If I said I want your body now
Would you hold it against me?

[Chorus]
If I said my heart was beating loud
If we could escape the crowd somehow
If I said I want your body now
Would you hold it against me?
'Cause, you feel like paradise
And I need a vacation tonight
So, if I said I want your body now
Would you hold it against me?




Said you're gonna be here in a minute
Sitting in the mirror getting pretty
Gotta look my best if we're gonna break up
Gotta look my best if we're gonna break up
I can hear you knocking on the front door and I know exactly what you came for
Trying to say goodbye but it's hot and heavy
Trying to say goodbye but it's hot and heavy
You touch me and it's breaking me down, and me down, and me down, and me down
I'm telling you, let's just give it up and get down, and get down, and get down
So come on!

Won't you give me something to remember?
Baby, shut your mouth and turn me inside out
Even though we couldn't last forever, baby, you know what I want right now
Hit me one more time, it's so amazing how you shook my world and flipped it upside down
You're the only one who ever drove me crazy 'cause you know me inside out
Inside out

I know that we probably shouldn't do this
Wake up in the morning feeling stupid
Said that we were done but you're all up on me
Said that we were done but you're all up on me
Tell me how we got in this position
Guess I gotta get you out my system
Trying to let you go but it's not that easy
Trying to let you go but it's not that easy
You touch me and it's breaking me down, and me down, and me down, and me down
I'm telling you, let's just give it up and get down, and get down, and get down
So come on!

Won't you give me something to remember?
Baby, shut your mouth and turn me inside out
Even though we couldn't last forever, baby, you know what I want right now
Hit me one more time, it's so amazing how you shook my world and flipped it upside down
You're the only one who ever drove me crazy 'cause you know me inside out
Inside out (out, out, out, out, out)

Inside out, out, out, out, out, out
Inside out
So come on!

Won't you give me something to remember?
Baby, shut your mouth and turn me inside out
Even though we couldn't last forever, baby (baby), you know what I want right now
Hit me one more time, it's so amazing how you shook my world and flipped it upside down
You're the only one who ever drove me crazy 'cause you know me inside out (out, out, out, out, out)



Lately, I've been stuck imagining what I wanna do and what I really think
Time to blow out
Be a little inappropriate, 'cause I know that everybody's thinkin' it when the light's out

[Bridge:]
Shame on me
To need release
Uncontrollably

[Chorus: x2]
I-I-I wanna go-oh-oh all the way-ay-ay
Taking out my freak tonight
I-I-I wanna show-oh-oh all the dirt-irt-irt I got runnin' through my mind, whoa oh

[Verse 2:]
Lately, people got me all tied up
There's a countdown waitin' for me to errupt
Time to blow out
I've been told who I should do it with, to keep both my hands above the blank-blanket when the light's out

[Bridge:]
Shame on me
To need release
Uncontrollably


I-I-I wanna go-oh-oh all the way-ay-ay
Taking out my freak tonight
I-I-I wanna show-oh-oh all the dirt-irt-irt I got runnin' through my mind, whoa oh

Shame on me (shame on me)
To need release (to need release)
Uncontrollably (uncontrollably, lably, lably, lably-bly-bly-bly-bly-bly)

Taking out my freak tonight
I-I-I wanna show-oh-oh all the dirt-irt-irt I got runnin' through my mind, whoa oh


I-I-I wanna go-oh-oh all the way-ay-ay
Taking out my freak tonight
I-I-I wanna show-oh-oh all the dirt-irt-irt I got runnin' through my mind, whoa oh

Black jack, whiskey straight
Every day changes your life
You got the look that you know
You're real bad, yeah, baby, you're right

Everybody loves you
Baby, you're the king of the night
And I'm the only one making sure to stay
Out of your sight

You know I can make your night
You wanna get it?
You got something that I like
But I might regret it

[Chorus:]
Me and you were a disaster
And you're only a danger to me
But the party ain't the same without you
That's why you're so good for everybody else
But you're trouble for me

Aw aw aw aw
Yeah, you're trouble for me
Aw aw aw aw
Trouble for me

[Verse 2:]
Sweet talk, here we go

You know I can make your night
You wanna get it?
You got something that I like
But I might regret it

Me and you were a disaster
And you're only a danger to me

Kiss, kiss, tip your glass
I'll do whatever you ask for
But if you want my love
You can only find it on the dancefloor

You know I can make your night
You wanna get it?
You got something that I like
But I might regret it

[Chorus:]
Me and you were a disaster
And you're only a danger to me

For tonight
It's just the two of us
Turn the light now
Just the two of us
Like how you, oh, whisper in my ear
Your breath like a ghost that disappeared

Hold me close, hold me close
Hold me tight now
Need you more, want you más
Feels so right now

Like how your hands feel me up and down
Like how your touch send me off the ground

[Chorus:]
Spread my wings out into the dark
I'll fly away on a trip to your heart
Break these chains that keep us apart
I'll fly away on a trip to your heart
(Ooh ooh ooh ooh, ooh ooh ooh ooh)
I'll fly away on a trip to your heart

Baby, can't believe you were sent to me
Like a postcard from my memory
Your body feels like a fantasy
This moment's all that I can see

Hold me close, strip me down
Hold me tight now
Need you more, want you más
Feels so right now

Like how your hands never let me down
Like how your touch send me off the ground

[Chorus:]
Spread my wings out into the dark
I'll fly away on a trip to your heart
Break these chains that keep us apart
I'll fly away on a trip to your heart
(Ooh ooh ooh ooh, ooh ooh ooh ooh)
I'll fly away on a trip to your heart

Trip to your eyes
Trip to your arms
Trip to your kiss
Trip to your lips
Trip to your tongue
Trip to your voice
Trip to your talk
Trip to your heart

Trip to your head
Trip to your chest
Trip to your breath
Trip to your skin
Trip to your sin
Trip to your touch
Trip to your tears
Trip to your heart

[Chorus:]
Spread my wings out into the dark
I'll fly away on a trip to your heart
Break these chains that keep us apart
I'll fly away on a trip to your heart
(Ooh ooh ooh ooh, ooh ooh ooh ooh)
I'll fly away on a trip to your heart




You're so bright
Like a dream
You burn up
Everything
We might make a scene
Ignite gasoline

When the music goes up
And the sun goes down
Lightning strikes
And I'm on the ground
Only one that I want around
Is you
Yeah...

[Chorus]
Spark and it's like gasoline
I start burning like a machine
My heart only runs on supreme
So hot, give me your gasoline
Yeah...
You set me on fire
You set me on fire
You set me on fire
Yeah...
You set me on fire
You set me on fire
You set me on fire
Yeah...

[Verse 2]
Heat wave
On the floor
Escape, exit door
Your touch, burning me
It's too much, gasoline

When the music goes up
And the sun goes down
Lightning strikes
And I'm on the ground
Only one that I want around
Is you
Yeah...

[Chorus]
Spark and it's like gasoline
I start burning like a machine
My heart only runs on supreme
So hot, give me your gasoline
Yeah...
You set me on fire
You set me on fire
You set me on fire

You set me on fire
You set me on fire
You set me on fire

He is a hustler, he's no good at all
He is a loser, he's a bum, bum, bum, bum
He lies, he bluffs, he's unreliable
He is a sucker with a gun, gun, gun, gun
I know you told me I should stay away
I know you said he's just a dog astray
He is a bad boy with a tainted heart
And even I know this ain't smart

[Chorus:]
But mama I'm in love with a criminal
And this type of love isn't rational, it's physical
Mama please don't cry, I will be alright
All reason aside I just can't deny, love the guy

[Verse 2:]
He is a villain by the devil's law
He is a killer just for fun, fun, fun, fun
That man's a snitch and unpredictable
He's got no conscience, he got none, none, none, none
Oh-ooooo I know-ooooo, should've let go, but no
'Cause he is a bad boy with a tainted heart
And even I know this ain't smart

[Chorus:]
But mama I'm in love with a criminal
And this type of love isn't rational, it's physical
Mama please don't cry, I will be alright
All reason aside I just can't deny, love the guy

[Bridge:]
And he's got my name
Tattooed on his arm
His lucky charm
So I guess it's OK
He's with me
And I hear people talk (people talk)
Try to make remarks
Keep us apart
But I don't even hear
I don't care

[Chorus:]
'Cause mama I'm in love with a criminal
And this type of love isn't rational, it's physical
Mama please don't cry, I will be alright
All reason aside I just can't deny, love the guy

(Oh-ooooo I know-ooooo)
Mama I'm in love with a criminal
(Should've let go)
And this type of love isn't rational,
(But no)
It's physical
(Oh-ooooo I know-ooooo)
Mama please don't cry, I will be alright
(Should've let go)
All reason aside
(But no)
I just can't deny, love the guy




Down and up and down and up and down and up and down
Down and up and down and up and down and up and down

[Verse 1]
I got all tricked up and came up to this thing
Lookin' so fire hot
A 20 out of 10
I saw you watching me, watching you on the floor
Hitting me up like, what you waiting for?

It's alright to say you want it
Get inside my dirty mind
Burns like ice the way I bring it
Again and again and again all night

[Hook]
The beat just dropped and the room got sexy
You're watching me like there's no one else around
I know you want me like kids want candy
So keep watching me go down and up and down

Down and up and down and up and down and up and down
Down and up and down and up and down and up and down

[Verse 2]
All of them girls you're with are probably hating me
But I don't care because I know it's jealousy
They see me on you
Like they think I'll give it up
But I ain't easy, just not afraid to crush

It's alright to say you want it
Get inside my dirty mind
Burns like ice the way I bring it
Again and again and again all night

[Hook]
The beat just dropped and the room got sexy
You're watching me like there's no one else around
I know you want me like kids want candy
So keep watching me go down and up and down
Down and up and down and up and down and up and down
Down and up and down and up and down and up and down

I can almost feel my lace slipping off cuz of the bass
I can tell that's what you're trippin' on
Tripping on, t-trip-t-tripping on
I can almost feel my lace slipping off cuz of the bass.
I can tell that's what you're trippin' on,
Tripping on, t-trip-t-tripping on

[Hook]
The beat just dropped and the room got sexy
You're watching me like there's no one else around
I know you want me like kids want candy
So keep watching me go down and up and down
Down and up and down and up and down and up and down
Down and up and down and up and down and up and down





I'm touching hands with someone seriously beautiful
I feel it burning and I know I'm standing far too close
I'm telling lies and if it shows I see that he don't care
I know he wants to take me home and get on out of here

I got someone waiting at home
He says he in love but lately I just don't know
He don't see me or make me feel hot
Banging in the club with all of my ladies and he don't know that

He about to lose, about to lose, about to lose me
He about to lose me
He about to lose, about to lose, about to lose me
He about to lose me

I feel my body losing focus as he touches me
And I should go but I can't overcome this chemistry
He pulls me close before he whispers something in my ear
He says he wants to take me home and get me out of here

I got someone waiting at home
He says he in love but lately I just don't know
He don't see me or make me feel hot
Banging in the club with all of my ladies and he don't know that

He about to lose, about to lose, about to lose me
He about to lose me
He about to lose, about to lose, about to lose me
He about to lose me

Someone by the bar keeps looking at us dancing
I see him staring at me, I see what he wants to be
Someone by the bar keeps looking at us dancing
I gotta, I gotta go
He don't know that

He about to lose, about to lose, about to lose me
He about to lose me
He about to lose, about to lose, about to lose me
He about to lose me
He about to lose, about to lose, about to lose me
He about to lose me
He about to lose, about to lose, about to lose me
He about to lose me

I'm touching hands with someone seriously beautiful

I'm a be a little selfish
Be a little selfish




Will you turn me up?
Yeah!

This is the making
Of another cold, rude awakening
It's been too long anticipating
Hurry up for my demonstration
So give undivided attention

Okay, light speed
Turbo, to get to me
Don't play, joke around
One shot, you're killin' me

[Chorus:]
Don't keep me waiting
Don't keep me waiting
My body's waiting
Don't keep me waiting
I'm going crazy, got me waiting
Come and take it from me
I'm going crazy, got me waiting
Come and take it from me
I'm going crazy, got me waiting
Come and take it from me
I'm going crazy, got me waiting
Come and take it from me

The time is tickin'
The train is boarding, you might miss it
Follow directions, damn it, listen
Before my body's in remission
So come to your destination

Okay, light speed
Turbo, to get to me
Don't play, joke around
One shot, you're killin' me

[Chorus:]
Don't keep me waiting
Don't keep me waiting
My body's waiting
Don't keep me waiting
I'm going crazy, got me waiting
Come and take it from me
I'm going crazy, got me waiting
Come and take it from me
I'm going crazy, got me waiting
Come and take it from me
I'm going crazy, got me waiting
Come and take it from me

[Bridge:]
What the hell?
I'm standin- wha- what the hell?
Stan- standing outside
I'm standing outside
Wha- wha- what- wha- wha-
What the hell!
I'm standing outside
Colder than the freezer
Come out and melt my ice
I'm running out of time
You're changing my demeanor
So get me to your ride
Before I change my mind
Don't apologize

[Chorus - Outro:]
Don't keep me waiting (Hey, hey, hey, hey!)
Don't keep me waiting (Hey, hey, hey, hey!)
My body's waiting (Hey, hey, hey, hey!)
Don't keep me waiting (Hey, hey, hey, hey!)

Don't keep me waiting (Hey, hey, hey, hey!)
My body's waiting (Hey, hey, hey, hey!)
Don't keep me waiting (Hey, hey, hey, hey!)
I'm going crazy, got me waiting
Come and take it from me
I'm going crazy, got me waiting
Come and take it from me
I'm going crazy, got me waiting
Come and take it from me
I'm going crazy, got me waiting
Come and take it from me





Baby, I don't know, how I'm gonna survive
This fatal attraction is going to eat me alive
I'm not supposed to want ya, but I do like I die
It's turned me into a monster, like I'm Jekyll & Hyde (Jekyll & Hyde)

I just want your body and I only need a little time
To satisfy this craving that I'm feeling inside
I just want your body and I know that you want mine
You're taking over my mind

It's scary, yeah
I think I need some hypnotherapy, yeah
'Cause when you stare at me
I wanna take over your body like, like, like it's freaky Friday
I wanna take you to a dark place
Make you, make you, make you do it my way
It's scary, yeah

This thing is so very
I want you so bad, it's scary
Baby, I want you so bad, it scares me

So scary

I don't wanna eat ya, I'll just make you mine
I'm gonna in-feed you, don't care if it's right
Oh I could just drink ya, till you can't take no more
I've never been so out of control

I just want your body and I only need a little time (yeah)
To satisfy this craving that I'm feeling inside
I just want your body and I know that you want mine
You're taking over my mind

It's scary, yeah

There was a time I was one of a kind 
Lost in the world out of me myself and I
Was lonely then like an alien
I tried but I never figured it out
Why I always felt like a stranger in a crowd
Ooh that was then like an alien

But the stars in the sky look like home, take me home
And the light in your eyes lets me know I'm not alone

Not alone not alone not alone
Not alone not alone not alone
Not alone not alone not alone
Not alone not alone not alone

Crossed through the universe to get where you are
Travel the night riding on a shooting star
Was lonely then like an alien
Had to get used to the world I was on
While yet still unsure if I knew where I belong
Ooh That was then like an alien

But the stars in the sky look like home , take me home
And the light in your eyes lets me know I'm not not alone

Not alone not alone not alone
Not alone not alone not alone
Not alone not alone not alone
Not alone not alone not alone

But the stars in the sky look like home , take me home
And the light in your eyes lets me know I'm not alone

Not alone not alone not alone
Not alone not alone not alone
Not alone not alone not alone
Not alone not alone not alone
(Not alone not alone not alone
Not alone not alone not alone
Not alone not alone not alone)

Big beat to blast ya

The bitch that you love enough

Do I imagine it, or do I see your stare?
Is there still longing there?
Oh I hate myself, and I feel crazy
Such a classic tale

Current girlfriend, ex-girlfriend, I’m trying to be cool
Am I being paranoid? Am I seeing things? Am I just insecure?

I want to believe
It’s just you and me
Sometimes it feels like there’s three of us in here, baby

So I wait for you to call
And I try to act natural
Have you been thinking ’bout her or about me?
And while I wait I put on my perfume,
Yeah, I want it all over you
I'm gonna mark my territory

I’ll never tell, tell on myself but I hope she smells my perfume
I’ll never tell, tell on myself but I hope she smells my perfume
I hide it well, hope you can’t tell but I hope she smells my perfume
I hide it well, hope you can’t tell but I hope she smells my perfume

I wanna fill the room when she’s in it with you
Please don’t forget me
Do I imagine it, or catch these moments?
I know you got history

But I’m your girlfriend, now I’m your girlfriend trying to be cool
I hope I’m paranoid, that I’m just seeing things, that I’m just insecure

I want to believe
It’s just you and me
Sometimes it feels like there’s three of us in here, baby

So I, wait for you to call
And I try to act natural
Have you been thinking ’bout her or about me?
And while I wait I put on my perfume,
Yeah, I want it all over you
I'm gonna mark my territory

So I, wait for you to call
And I try to act natural
Have you been thinking ’bout her or about me?
And while I wait I put on my perfume,
Yeah, I want it all over you
I'm gonna mark my territory

I’ll never tell, tell on myself but I hope she smells my perfume

I've been thinking
Just sitting thinking
On why I love you
And all my reasons
And if I lost you
Boy, if I lost you
I'd lose myself
And I wouldn't feel the way I feel now

You bring me zen
Yes, you bring me zen
You make me feel like a million, billion
I'll let you in
But don't you break my heart
Don't you rip me apart, no, don't you rip me apart

[Hook]
Baby, love, it should be easy
It shouldn't be complicated
It should be easy
I don't know how else to say it, say it, say it, say it

[Instrumental]

(I don't know how to say it)

[Verse 2]
I've got visions
Boy, I've got visions of me and you
Happily just living
And though they're out there, them beautiful men
But you're my future, baby, you're my right now

If there was a scale from 1 to 10
On my love for you, it's a million, billion
Boy, I'll love you till the day I'm dead
So please, don't mess with my head
Please, don't mess with my head

[Hook]
Baby, love, it should be easy
It shouldn't be complicated
It should be easy
I don't know how else to say it, say it, say it, say it

(To love, to love, to love...)

I don't know how...

Treat her like an animal, somebody call PETA

Then put the bank in her have her running like a meter
On a cab in the city where the girls are pretty
Find me in the club where the girls get busy
With a flask and the fat booty nice shaped titties
My wrist so froze you could ice skate with it

I'm blind from the tears that fall like rain
So lost ever since you went away
Sometimes our lives forever change
My heart's never gonna be the sa-a-ame'
Cause you ca-a-a-me
And you g-a-ave me, a pla-a-ace
Place to lay-ay-ay, all my pa-a-ay
Why you ta-a-ake it aw-a-ay?

You never know what you got till it's gone
You never know what you got till it's gone
You never, you never, you never, you never
You never know what you got till it's...
Gone, gone, gone, gone...
Till it's gone, gone, gone, gone...
You never know what you got till it's gone

I try every night to turn the page
But daylight can't confine me to a cage
In my mind, the life we had replays
Now everywhere I turn I see your fa-a-ace'
Cause you ca-a-a-me
And you g-a-ave me, a pla-a-ace
Place to lay-ay-ay, all my pa-a-ay
Why you ta-a-ake it aw-a-ay?

You never know what you got till it's gone
You never know what you got till it's gone
You never, you never, you never, you never
You never know what you got till it's...
Gone, gone, gone, gone...
Till it's gone, gone, gone, gone...
You never know what you got till it's gone

Oh wo-oah
Oh wo-oah
Oh wo-oah
Over memories I'm saving
So your love is never fading
Holding on, my heart is breaking
Can't let go

You never know what you got till it's gone
Gone, gone, gone, gone
Till it's gone, gone, gone
You never know what you got till it's gone
Gone, gone, gone
Till it's gone, gone, gone, gone
You never know what you got till it's gone
Gone, gone, gone, gone
Till it's gone, gone, gone
You never know what you got till it's gone




I can't let go of control
I can't let go and not know
Don't know the way you're heading me
One day at a time is all I need
There was a time without trust
There was a time without love
But it took you to show me
I could handover the keys

I'll let you lead the way now
Cause I want you to take the wheel
I've never been a passenger though
I never knew how good it could feel 
The road will twist and turn but
I know that I am in good hands
I've never been a passenger no
But we'll see more without a map
Without a map 
Without a map
Without a map

So let's take a walk and get lost
Let's take a chance on finding us
I wanna see the world with you
Every step feels so brand new
It's hard to jump with no net
But I've jumped and got no regret
My co-pilot yeah that's right
Now I can just enjoy the ride 

I'll let you lead the way now
Cause I want you to take the wheel
I've never been a passenger though
I never knew how good it could feel 
The road will twist and turn but
I know that I am in good hands
I've never been a passenger no
But we'll see more without a map
Without a map 
Without a map
Without a map

And now we're finally falling
Cause I was giving you half now I'm all in
My hands in the air while you're driving 
This is living
This is living
This is living
Yeah

I'll let you lead the way now
Cause I want you to take the wheel
I've never been a passenger though
I never knew how good it could feel 
The road will twist and turn but
I know that I am in good hands
I've never been a passenger no
But we'll see more without a map
Without a map 
Without a map
Without a map


You, you, you...

[Britney:]
I laughed so much that I cried
I danced so much til I was tired
I drank some red wine and now I'm walking on the sky
I had the time of my life

And you know, I, I, I

'Cause I don't got to worry 'bout a thing

And you know, I, I, I

If they told me it's over
I wouldn't believe it
Because you know we both care
But we got to get over, over the mountain
We can't keep standing, standing there
Let's move on and be stronger
Even though we can't go
Let go, can't hold on
When love's broken

This is gonna be our last goodbye
Our love is gone, but I'll survive
Hide my tears and dry my eyes
You don't need to see me cry
Pack my bags, can't take no more
Adios, I'm out the door
Hide your tears and dry your eyes
'Cause I don't want to see you cry

Don't cry, don't cry, cry, cry
Don't cry, cry, don't cry, don't cry
Cry, cry

In the beginning we were both crazy
We were crazy in love
But now that it's ending
We're just crazy
Because we love with no more trust
Can't go on any longer
Babe, we gotta let it go
Move on, can't hold on
When love's broken

This is gonna be our last goodbye
Our love is gone, but I'll survive
Hide my tears and dry my eyes
You don't need to see me cry
Pack my bags, can't take no more
Adios, I'm out the door
Hide your tears and dry your eyes
'Cause I don't want to see you cry

This is gonna be our last goodbye
Our love is gone, but I'll survive
Hide my tears and dry my eyes
You don't need to see me cry
Pack my bags, can't take no more
Adios, I'm out the door
Hide your tears and dry your eyes
'Cause I don't want to see you cry

Don't cry, don't cry, cry, cry
Don't cry, cry, don't cry, don't cry
Cry, cry


You are the light of my beautiful life
You are the light of my beautiful life

You know I wake up and everyday,
I feel safe knowing that you got my back now and forever
Living my life 'cause I've got nothing to do
When a tear falls,
You put your hands out, you catch my tears,
And I'm feeling so close to your love now
If I was lost, I've found my way

I lift my hands and pray 'cause life is tough somedays
But I will not lose faith 'cause you will lead the way

You're my light when it gets dark
You're always in my heart
You're my brightest morning star
You're my light when it gets dark
You're always in my heart
You're my brightest morning star
You are the light of my beautiful life
I can never let go, you're my brightest morning star
You are the light of my beautiful life
I can never let go, you're my brightest morning star

In you arms I feel alive, I am not afraid
I will keep you, listen closely,
I look for signs everyday

I lift my hands and pray 'cause life is tough somedays
But I will not lose faith 'cause you will lead the way

You're my light when it gets dark
You're always in my heart
You're my brightest morning star
You're my light when it gets dark
You're always in my heart

So wicked
In the way he moves
Don't miss it
Do not be a fool

It's a long way
It's a long way home
Light inside of me
It ignites my bones

He comes to me in my dreams
And tells me what I need to know
He makes me feel so at ease
And guides me to the lights above
I just wanna fall into his arms tonight
Someone tell me I, I will be alright
Hold on tight

Remembering, I forever will
Surrendering, just to how we felt

It's a long way
It's a long way home
Light inside of me
It ignites my bones

He comes to me in my dreams
And tells me what I need to know
He makes me feel so at ease
And guides me to the lights above
I just wanna fall into his arms tonight
Someone tell me I, I will be alright
Hold on tight

And when it's all the thunder and rain
The cinema is fading away
I gotta make my way through the night
Holding on with all of my might
And when I'm lost, and I can't the find the way
I feel the pieces breaking away
Hold myself with all of my might
Don't let go
Just hold on tight

He comes to me in my dreams
And tells me what I need to know
He makes me feel so at ease
And guides me to the lights above
I just wanna fall into his arms tonight
Someone tell me I, I will be alright
Hold on tight



On a shameless night
In a nameless place
I thought that love was a hopeless case 'til I found you ('til I found you)
Lived a wasteful life in a hateful city
There was no love, just pain and pity 'til I found you ('til I found you)

And you don't know how you saved me
And you don't know what you gave me
And you don't know how you saved my life

I can see the light
I have flown away
I have come alive
I am blown away
I have felt the love
I can see the truth
Now that I found you, now that I found you

I can live my life
I believe in faith
I have found myself
I have lost the hate
I have felt the love
I can see the truth
Now that I found you, now that I found you

[Instrumental]

On a shameless night

Now that I found you, now that I found you

Yeah



One, two, three,
Not only you and me.
Got 180 degrees and I'm caught inbetween.
Countin' one, two, three...
Peter, Paul and Mary.
Getting down with 3P, everybody loves... Uh!
Countin'...

One, two...
One, one, one, one, two, three...
Countin' one, two...
Countin' one, one, two, three...

Babe, pick a night
To come out and play.
If it's alright,
What do you say?

Merrier the more,
Triple fun that way,
Twister on the floor.
What do you say?

Are you in?
Living in sin is the new thing, yeah...
Are you in?
I am counting...

[Chorus]
One, two, three,
Not only you and me.
Got 180 degrees and I'm caught inbetween.
Countin' one, two, three...
Peter, Paul and Mary.
Getting down with 3P, everybody loves... Uh!
Countin' one, two, three,
Not only you and me.
Got 180 degrees and I'm caught inbetween.
Countin' one, two, three...
Peter, Paul and Mary.
Getting down with 3P, everybody loves... Uh!

Three is a charm,
Two is not the same.
I don't see them harm,
So are you game?

Let's make a team,
Make 'em say my name
Loving the extreme.
Now, are you game?

Are you in?
Living in sin is the new thing, yeah...
Are you in?
I am counting...

[Repeat Chorus]

What we do is innocent,
Just for fun and nothing meant.
If you don't like the company,
Let's just do it you and me (You and me...).
You and me (You and me...),
Or three (Or three... or three...),
Or four on the floor.

Do you taste it, do you feel what I feel
I feel it coming, and it's oh so near
You got me breathing like an animal
I won't be satisfied until you're here (911)

Every little time you touch my thighs I wanna cry (oh, I wanna cry)
Every little touch you take me deeper in my mind (oh, I'm going deeper)
Every little thing you do I swear I'm on a ride (Oh)
You got me hypnotized (hypnotized), you got me hypnotized (911)

911, I call you when I'm feeling lonely
911, baby boy come get right on me
911, put this fire out I'm burning up, up up
911

Do you know just what you do to me
What I'm needing, oh it's criminal
Close my eyes and you're undressing me
One step further boy and we will be (911)

Every little time you touch my thighs I want to cry (oh, I wanna cry)
Every little touch you take me deeper in my mind (oh, I'm going deeper)
Every little thing you do I swear I'm on a ride (Oh)
You got me hypnotized (hypnotized), you got me hypnotized (911, hypnotized)

911, I call you when I'm feeling lonely
911, baby boy come get right on me
911, put this fire out I'm burning up, up, up
911

Sexing in the attic
When you felt so automatic 
Felt explosive when you had it
When you all over me

Boy I made it rain
Just when I squeezed and made it tight
Just so relaxed, so don't you fight 
Just calm down, feel the freaking heat

911

Every little time you touch my thighs I want to cry (oh, I wanna cry)
Every little touch you take me deeper in my mind (oh, I'm going deeper)
Every little thing you do I swear I'm on a ride (Oh)
You got me hypnotized (hypnotized), you got me hypnotized (911)

911, I call you when I'm feeling lonely
911, baby boy come get right on me
911, put this fire out I'm burning up, up up

Let me see your passport
Please take off your glasses
Gotta get through customs, taxi, baggage
You know you still love me
Sicily to the U.K
Keep them hands up everywhere follow me I’m about to take you abroad

Show up in your town
Second that I’m touchin down
Go someplace we’ve been
Every time I’m with my friends
Sexy men
Whisper foreign in my ear
She’s so hot
You so naughty come on show me what you got
What you got

Looked in the mirror today
Thought I had so much to say
But now that I’m face to face
I feel like runnin away
(I need a)

time for a break a holiday
time that I make my great escape
I need it now
I need it today
I need it today

Don’t know where I’m goin but I know I’m outta here
Don’t know where I’m goin but I know I’m outta here
Don’t know where I’m goin but I know I’m outta here
I’m goin abroad.. I’m goin abroad..

I don’t speak the language
But they know my name here
Frequent flier mileage
Platinum next year
No fear
Bonjour in France
Keep my head wrapped up in Hermes
Tropical destination
Get my rest and my relaxation abroad

Show up in your town
Second that I’m Touchin down
Go someplace we’ve been
Every time I’m with my friends
Sexy men
Whisper foreign in my ear
She’s so hot
You so naughty come on show me what you got
What you got

Today
I need a change of pace
To see some different faces
I need to get away
I need a break from u
I need a break for me
Gimme a break from here
Somewhere that I can clear my head
I’m goin abroad
I’m goin abroad
