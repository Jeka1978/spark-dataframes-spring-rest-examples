 Cirrus Minor
In a churchyard by a river
Lazing in the haze of midday
Laughing in the grasses and the graze
Yellow bird, you are alone in singing and in flying on
In and in leaving, willow weeping in the water
Waving to the river daughters
Swaying in the ripples and the reeds
On a trip to, saw a crater in the sun
A thousand miles of moonlight later 


 The Nile Song
I was standing by the Nile
When I saw the lady smile
I would take her out for a while
For a while. Light tears wept like a child
How her golden hair was blowing wild
Then she spread her wings to fly
For to fly. Soaring high above the breezes
Going always where she pleases
She will make it to the island in the sun
I will follw in her shadow
As I watch her from my window
One day I will catch her eye
She is calling from the deep
Summoning my soul to endless sleep
She is bound to drag me down
Drag me down


 Crying Song
We smile and smile
We smile and smile
Laughter echoes in your eyes
We climb and climb
We climb and climb
Footfall softly in the pines
We cry and cry
We cry and cry
Sadness passes in a while
We role and role
We role and role
Help me role away the stone 


 Up The Khyber
(instrumental) 


 Green Is The Color
Heavy hung the canopy of blue
Shade my eyes and I can see you
White is the light that shines through 
The dress that you wore
She lay in the shadow of the wave
Hazy were the visions of her playing
Sunlight on her eyes 
But moonshine beat her blind everytime
Green is the colour of her kind
Quickness of the eye deceives the mind
Many is the bond 
Between the hopefull and the damned 


 Cymbaline
The path you tread is narrow 
And the drop is shear and very high
The ravens all are watching 
From a vantage point near by
Apprehension creeping like a choo-train up your spine
Will the tightrope reach the end 
Will the final cuplet rhyme
And it's high time
Cymbaline
It's high time
Cymbaline
Please wake me 
Butterfly with broken wings is falling by your side
The ravens all are closing in 
There's no where you can hide
Your manager and agent are both busy on the phone
Selling colored photographs to magazines back home
And it's high time
Cymbaline
It's high time
Cymbaline
Please wake me The lines converging where you stand 
They must have moved the picture plane
The leaves are heavy around your feet 
You hear the thunder of the train
Suddenly it strikes you that they're moving into range
Doctor Strange is always changing size
And it's high time
Cymbaline
It's high time
Cymbaline
Please wake me And it's high time
Cymbaline
It's high time
Cymbaline
Please wake me

 Ibiza Bar
I'm so afraid of mistakes that I made
Taking every time that I wake
I feel like a hard-boiled butter man
So give me a time 
When the countries will lie on the storyline 
If kind Are days are made since the first page
I've lived every line that you wrote
Take me down, take me down 
From the shelf above your head
So give me a time 
When the countries will lie on the storyline 
If kind And if I live on the shelf like the rest
And if love bleeds like a sad song
Please pick-up your camera and use me again
So give me a time 
When the countries will lie on the storyline 
If kind
Yea

 A Spanish Piece
Bath of tequila, Manuel
Leaf and cringle
Laugh at my lisp and kill you
I think
This Spanish music
It sets my soul on fire
Lovely seniorita
Your eyes are like stars
Your teeth are like pearls
Your ruby lips seniorita
