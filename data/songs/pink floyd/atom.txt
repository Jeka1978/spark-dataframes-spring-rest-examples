 Atom Heart Mother
(instrumental)

Father's Shout 
Breast Milky 
Mother Fore 
Funky Dung
("Here is a now internouncement") 
Mind Your Throats Please
("Silence in the studio") 
Remergence 

 If
If I were a swan, I'd be gone
If I were a train, I'd be late
And if I were a good man 
I'd talk with you more often than I do
If I were to sleep, I could dream
If I were afraid, I could hide
If I go insane 
Please don't put your wires in my brain

If I were the moon, I'd be cool
If I were a book, I would bend
If I were a good man 
I'd understand the spaces between friends
If I were alone, I would cry
And if I were with you, I'd be home and dry
And if I go insane 
Will you still let me join in with the game?

If I were a swan, I'd be gone
If I were a train, I'd be late again
If I were a good man 
I'd talk to you more often than I do


 Summer '68
Would you like to something before you leave?
Perhaps you'd care to state exactly how you feel
We say goodbye before we've said hello
I hardly even like you
I shouldn't care at all
We met just six hours ago
The music was too loud
From your bed I came today and lost a bloody year
And I would like to know, how do you feel?
How do you feel?

Not a single word was said
They lied still without fears
Occasionally you showed a smile, but what was the need?
I felt the cold far too soon in a wind of ninetyfive
My friends are lying in the sun, I wish I was there
Tomorrow brings another town, another girl like you
Have you time before you leave to greet another man
Just to let me know, how do you feel?
How do you feel?

Goodbye to you
Childish bangles too
I've had enough for one day


 Fat Old Sun
When the fat old sun in the sky is falling
Summer evening birds are calling
Summer's thunder time of year
The sound of music in my ears
Distant bells
New mown grass smells so sweet
By the river holding hands
Roll me up and lay me down
And if you sit
Don't make a sound
Pick your feet up off the ground
And if you hear as the warm night falls
The silver sound from a time so strange
Sing to me, sing to me

When that fat old sun in the sky is falling
Summer evening birds are calling
Children's laughter in my ears
The last sunlight disappears

And if you sit
Don't make a sound
Pick your feet up off the ground
And if you hear as the warm night falls
The silver sound from a time so strange
Sing to me, sing to me
