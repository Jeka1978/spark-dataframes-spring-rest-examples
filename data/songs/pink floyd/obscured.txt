Obscured By Clouds by Pink Floyd




 Burning Bridges
Bridges burning gladly
Merging with the shadows
Flickering between the lines
Stolen moments floating softly on the air
Born on wings of fire and climbing higher
Ancient bonds are breaking
Moving on and changing sides
Dreaming of a new day
Cast aside the other way
Magic visions stirring
Kindled by and burning flames rise in her eyes
The door stands ajar
The wall that once were high
Beyond the gilded cage
Beyond the reach of ties
The moment is at hand
She breaks the golden band


 The Gold It's In The...
Come on, my friends
Let's make for the hills
They say there's gold but I'm looking for thrills
You can get your hands on whatever we find
Because I'm only coming along for the ride
Well, you go your way
I'll go mine
I don't care if we get there on time
Everybody's searching for something, they say
I'll get my kicks on the way
Over mountains, across seas
Who knows what will be waiting for me?
I could sail forever to strange sounding names
Faces of people and places don't change
All I have to do is just close my eyes
To see the seagulls wheeling on those far distant skies
All I want to tell you
All I want to say is count me in on the journey
Don't expect me to stay


 Wots...Uh The Deal
Heaven said the promised land
Looks allright from where I stand
Cause I'm the man on the outside looking in
Waiting on the first step
Show where the key is kept
Point me down the right line because it's time
To let me in from the cold
Turn my land into gold
Cause there's chill wind blowing in my soul
And I think I'm growing old

Flash the readies wots...uh the deal
Got to make to the next meal
Try to keep up with the turning of the wheel
Mile after mile
Stone after stone
Turn to speak but you're alone
Million mile from home you're on your own
So let me in from the cold
Turn my land into gold
Cause there's chill wind blowing in my soul
And I think I'm growing old

Fly bright by candlelight
Up out of my sight
And if she prefers we will never stir again
Someone said: "The promised land"
And I grabbed it with both hands
Now I'm the man on the inside looking out
Hear me shout:
"Come on in,
what's the news and where you been?"
Cause there's no wind left in my soul
And I've grown old

 Childhood's End
You shout in your sleep
Perhaps the price is just too steep
Is your conscience at rest
If once put to the test?

You awake with a stars
To just the beating of your heart
Just one man beneath the skies
Just two ears, just two eyes

You set sail across the sea
Of longpast thoughts and memories
Childhood's end
Your fantasies merge with harsh realities

And then as the sail is hoist
You find your eyes are growing moist
All the fears never voiced
Say you have to make your final choice

Who are you and who am I
To say we know the reason why
Some are born; Some men die
beneath one infinite sky

There'll be war, there'll be peace
But everything one day will cease
All the iron'll turn to rust
All the proud men'll turn to dust

And so all things, time will mend
So this song will end


 Free Four
The memories of a man in his old age
Are the deeds of a man in his prime
You suffle in gloom in the sickroom
And talk to yourself 'till you die

Life is a short, warm moment
And death is a long cold rest
You get your chance to try
In the twinkling of an eye
Eighty years, with luck, or even less

So all aboard for the American tour
And maybe you'll make it to the top
And mind how you go
I can tell you, 'cause I know
You may find it hard to get off

You are the angel of death
And I am the dead man's son
And he died like a mole in a fox hole
And everyone is still in the run
And who is the master of fox hounds?
And who says the hunt has begun?
And who calls the tune in the courtroom?
And who beats the funeral drum?

The memories of a man in his old age
Are the deeds of a man in his prime
You suffle in gloom in the sickroom
And talk to yourself 'till you die


 Stay
Stay and help me to end the day
And if you don't mind
We'll break a bottle of wine
Stick around and maybe we'll put one down
Because I wanna find what lies behind those eyes
Midnight blue burning gold
A yellow moon is growing cold

I rise, looking through my morning eyes
Surprised to find you by my side
Rack my brain to try to remember your name
To find the words to tell you goodbye
Morning dues
Newborn day
Midnight blue turn to gray
Midnight blue burning gold
A yellow moon is growing cold


 Absolutely Curtains
