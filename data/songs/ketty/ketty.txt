How could I see you when I was so blind
How could I grasp you when I was far behind
How could I hear you when I was so deaf
How could I get up when I had been left

But You said, don't worry
For I've healed the blind man
And I've set the captives free
And You said, don't worry
For all you've gotta do
Is put your trust in me

How could I be clean when I was so dirty
How could I be made whole when I was torn apart
Make me whole, make me whole
Make me whole again

But You said, don't worry
For I've healed the blind man
And I've set the captives free
And You said, don't worry
For all you've gotta do
Is put your trust in me

But You said, don't worry
For I've healed the blind man
And I've set the captives free
And You said, don't worry
For all you've gotta do
Is put your trust in me

And You said, don't worry
For I've healed the blind man
And I've set the captives free
And You said, don't worry
For all you've gotta do
Is put your trust in me




Living in fear
Is not what you had
In mind for me
But holding to you
Is so hard
I cling to what I see

In a world where my emotions
Seem to rule my every move
They will challenge my devotion
To seek and know the truth

You're piercing me
This self will bleed
You're killing all
Of my securities
Lord, help me see the reality
That all I'll ever need is You

Here in this haze a distant light
Seems to draw me near
But in the shadow of my doubt
My faith just disappears

In a world where my emotions
Seem to rule my every move
They will challenge my devotion
To seek and know the truth

You're piercing me
This self will bleed
You're killing all
Of my securities
Lord, help me see the reality
That all I'll ever need is you

You're piercing me
This self will bleed
You're killing all
Of my securities
Lord, help me see the reality
That all I'll ever need is you

You're piercing me
This self will bleed
You're killing all
Of my securities
Lord, help me see the reality
That all I'll ever need is you

You're piercing me
This self will bleed
You're killing all
Of my securities
Lord, help me see the reality
That all I'll ever need is you




Through this skin you see
My heart
Through this laughter you feel
My pain
Even through this mask you see
My face
For You are the only one who really knows just who I am

And you search me
And you know all the secrets of my heart
And you search me
Revealing the mysteries of who You are
You search me

Growing up never comes
Easily
In Your hands, You're the potter
Molding me
Then why do I wear this mask and play this game
Of hide and seek
When You are the only one who really knows just who I am

And you search me
And you know all the secrets of my heart
And you search me
Revealing the mysteries of who You are
And you search me
And you know all the secrets of my heart
And you search me
Revealing the mysteries of who You are

My Father, my Father
You are my Father, oh, and I am Your child
And you hear my cry, even at the midnight

And you search me
And you know all the secrets of my heart
And you search me
Revealing the mysteries of who You are
And you search me
And you know all the secrets of my heart
And you search me
Revealing the mysteries of who You are
the mysteries of who You are
the mysteries of who You are

You would think
that I could find
a simple song,
a photograph of mine
To show this public eye,
what I have to offer
I may not have a PHD,
or speak
in eloquent philosophy!
I'm nothing more
than simply me you see!

What I am trying to say
I'm just a babe
in so many ways!

I'm still growing,
still stretchin'
Still breaking
in these new shoes
Looking for a way
to make a mark of my own
I'm just a spring chick,
wet behind the ears
It's a part of life
so there's no need to fear
These growing pains
that I'm going through

I don't regret,
I'm not ashamed
that I haven't yet begun
to speaketh ways...
(As the wisest of men),
oh perhaps some day
But for now I'm grateful
to be a part
of the family tree,
while The Man upstairs
does His work on me
It's a job that may
take eternity to complete

Just when I've learned
all I can,
those growing
Pains up
and kick on in again!

I'm still growing,
still stretchin'
Still breaking
in these new shoes
Looking for a way
to make a mark of my own
I'm just a spring chick,
wet behind the ears
It's a part of life
so there's no need to fear
These growing pains
that I'm going through

Time after time,
one more time and again,
will it ever end?
It's the lessons in our lives
that make us wise
But young or old
I am told it's the same
Oh, these growing pains
never go away,
so I'll just
keep on trying

[Music break]

What I am trying to say
I'm just a babe
in so many ways!

I'm still growing,
still stretchin'
Still breaking
in these new shoes
Looking for a way
to make a mark of my own
I'm just a spring chick,
wet behind the ears
It's a part of life
so there's no need to fear
These growing pains
that I'm going through
These growing pains

Oh, baby don't worry
about a thing!

(Thank you
Thank you very much
Thank you
Thank you)





I turn my head, there's nothing there
All I own is my thoughts for my fears
I close the door to keep out the bad
I plug my ears to keep out these fears

And I cry

So hold me close 
For I'm so tired of holding myself
So very tired and tired 
Tired and tired
Just hold me 

I listen to these voices 
Or is it this house that's giving me chills
As I lie upon this little girls bed?
Who's at the door? Who's walking near?
Or has my imagination spilled?
This little girl all grown up still fears

Oh, and I cry

So hold me close 
For I'm so tired of holding myself
So very tired and tired 
Tired and tired
Just hold me 

Where can I go, where can I hide
from these evil sufferings?
Oh, these images painted on my walls
They say there's a place that I can
hide in the shadow of your wings
Oh Lord, bring me to this place of refuge

No more tears

So hold me close 
For I'm so tired of holding myself
So very tired and tired 
Tired and tired
Just hold me



If You came by me
would I crown You my King
Or brush You off as though
I really didn't see
If You walked by my side
would our souls then be unified
I swore Your name
would never be denied

But I took up this hammer
And laughed at all Your slander
And pierced Your hands
With the nails of blasphemy
How could I do this? I don't know
Said something forced me to it, so
Spit in Your face and passed You by

But time and time again
I'd live that life of sin
I knew it hurt you bad
but I wasn't ready to give in
Maybe someday,
but not this day I said
I wanted to live my life
I was willing to pay the price

But I took up this hammer
And laughed at all Your slander
And pierced Your hands
With the nails of blasphemy
How could I do this? I don't know
Said something forced me to it, so
Spit in Your face and passed You by
('Cause I'd forgotten those words
your name won't be denied)

But looking into my eyes
I knew You felt this heart's cry
I needed You
bad my life was oh so sad
But looking back at all this pain,
this guilt, this strife
Would You take it all away
if I were to give you back my life?

But You said
I've forgiven thee
And You said
I've forgiven thee
And You said
I've forgiven thee
And You said
I've forgiven thee

He was hanging on a cross
With a crown of thorns
in His head
He was hanging on a cross
With a crown of thorns
in His head
He was hanging on a cross
With a crown of thorns
in His head
He was hanging on a cross
With a crown of thorns
in His head

And You said
I've forgiven thee
And You said
I've forgiven thee
And You said
I've forgiven thee
And You said
I've forgiven thee

You could throw me
In the fire
And I won't be burned
For my faith
Is Your desire
And Your love endures

You could throw me
In the prison cell
Shackle me up
Against the rail
But time
And time again
My faith won't fail

For He'll prevail
In the midst of all
My trials
And tribulations
And He'll prevail
In the midst of all
My sin
And temptations
He'll prevail
When I fall
And He
Will pick me up
For time
And time again
My faith won't fail
Time and time again
My faith won't fail

You could cast me
In the lion's den
But they won't harm me
For Your grace
Surrounds me
And it sets me free

And I can walk
Upon the water
And I will not drown
For my eyes are
Set upon You
And no one
Can bring me down

For He'll prevail
In the midst of all
My trials
And tribulations
And He'll prevail
In the midst of all
My sin
And temptations
He'll prevail
When I fall
And He
Will pick me up
For time
And time again
My faith won't fail
Time and time again
My faith won't fail

For His angels
Surround me
And You've poured out
This blood covering
And I will walk
And not fail
For time
And time again
My faith won't fail
Time
And time again
My faith won't fail

For He'll prevail
In the midst of all
My trials
And tribulations
And He'll prevail
In the midst of all
My sin
And temptations
He'll prevail
When I fall
And He
Will pick me up
For time
And time again

For He'll prevail
In the midst of all
My trials
And tribulations
And He'll prevail
In the midst of all
My sin
And temptations
He'll prevail
When I fall
And He
Will pick me up
For time
And time again
My faith won't fail
Time and time again
My faith won't fail
Time and time again
My faith won't fail




Did it seem
To disappoint you
Living alone?
By the banks
Of your dilemma
Out of control
No one seems
To give the answers
That you wanna hear
What you'd give
To find a welcome here

Miles and miles of lies
Behind you
Those were the days
So many lives
You'd hope would guide you
Help you find a way
Now it seems to your surprise
That they left you lying here
What you'd give to dry
These bitter tears

Did it come naturally?
You a million miles from home
When you tried so carefully
To live a life
That's not your own
Always remember
That it wasn't that long ago
I stilled the oceans
I moved the mountains
To say I love you

Heaven waits
The hours of silence
Finds you on your knees
Broken in a sweet surrender
Of peace
All the years of searching
for a love you didn't know
Now you've finally found
A welcome home

Did it come naturally?
You a million miles from home
When you tried so carefully
To live a life
That's not your own
Always remember
That it wasn't that long ago
I stilled the oceans
I moved the mountains
To say I love you

I love you, I have
And I always will.

Did it come naturally?
You a million miles from home
When you tried so carefully
To live a life
That's not your own
Always remember
That it wasn't that long ago
I stilled the oceans
I moved the mountains
To say

Did it come naturally?
You a million miles from home
When you tried so carefully
To live a life
That's not your own
Always remember
That it wasn't that long ago
I stilled the oceans
I moved the mountains
To say I love you




When there's nothing left to give
I will give you more than I ever gave before
When there's nothing left left to say
I'll say it all again, but until then...

And I'll give you my heart, say I love you
Say I love you
And I'll give you my heart, say I love you
Oh, cause I do, Jesus

No music to play so I sing you my own song
Come on and sing along
When there's nothing that remains
You still stay the same
You're looking so strong

And I'll give you my heart, say I love you
Say I love you
And I'll give you my heart, say I love you
Oh, cause I do

And I'll give you my heart, say I love you
I'm gonna, I'm gonna say I love you
And I'll give you my heart, say I love you
Oh, cause I do, sweet Jesus

When there's nothing left to give
I will give you more than I ever gave before

I'm gonna give you my heart
I'm gonna give you my heart




I saw a spider, I didn't scream
'Cause I can belch the alphabet
Just double dog dare me
And I chose guitar over ballet
And I take these suckers down
'Cause they just get in my way

The way you look at me is kinda like a little sister
Your high five, your goodbyes
And it leaves me nothing but blisters

[Chorus:]
So I don't wanna be one of the boys
One of your guys
Just give me a chance to prove to you tonight
That I just wanna be one of the girls
Pretty in pearls
Not one of the boys

So over the summer something changed
I started reading "Seventeen" and shaving my legs
And I studied "Lolita" religiously
And I walked right into school and caught you staring at me

'Cause I know what you know
But now you're gonna have to take a number
It's OK
Maybe one day
But not until you give me my diamond ring

[Chorus:]
'Cause I don't wanna be one of the boys
One of your guys
Just give me a chance to prove to you tonight
That I just wanna be your homecoming queen
Pin-up poster dream
Not one of the boys

I wanna be a flower
Not a dirty weed
I wanna smell like roses
Not a baseball team
And I swear maybe one day you're gonna
Wanna make out, make out, make out with me

(Don't wanna be) don't wanna be
(Don't wanna be) don't wanna be
(Don't wanna be)

[Chorus:]
'Cause I don't wanna be one of the boys
One of your guys
Just give me a chance to prove to you tonight
That I just wanna be one of the girls
Pretty in pearls
And not one of the boys








This was never the way I planned, not my intention.
I got so brave, drink in hand, lost my discretion
It's not what I'm used to, just wanna try you on.
I'm curious for you, caught my attention.

[Chorus:]
I kissed a girl and I liked it,
the taste of her cherry chapstick.
I kissed a girl just to try it,
I hope my boyfriend don't mind it.
It felt so wrong,
it felt so right.
Don't mean I'm in love tonight.
I kissed a girl and I liked it (I liked it).

No, I don't even know your name, it doesn't matter.
You're my experimental game, just human nature.
It's not what good girls do, not how they should behave.
My head gets so confused, hard to obey.

[Chorus]

Us girls we are so magical,
Soft skin, red lips, so kissable.
Hard to resist, so touchable.
Too good to deny it.
Ain't no big deal, it's innocent.

[Chorus]




You gotta help me out
It's all a blur last night
We need a taxi 'cause you're hung-over and I'm broke
I lost my fake ID but you lost the motel key
Spare me your freakin' dirty looks
Now don't blame me
You want to cash out and get the hell out of town

[Chorus:]
Don't be a baby
Remember what you told me
Shut up and put your money where your mouth is
That's what you get for waking up in Vegas
Get up and shake the glitter off your clothes now
That's what you get for waking up in Vegas

Why are these lights so bright?
Oh, did we get hitched last night dressed up like Elvis?
Why am I wearing your class ring?
Don't call your mother
'cause now we're partners in crime

[Chorus]

You got me into this
Information overload, situation lost control
Send out an S.O.S.
And get some cash out
We're gonna tear up the town

Don't be a baby
Remember what you told me [x3]
Told me, told me...
Shut up and put your money where your mouth is
That's what you get for waking up in Vegas
Get up and shake the glitter off your clothes, now
That's what you get for waking up in Vegas
That's what you get, baby
Shake the glitter, shake, shake, shake the glitter, c'mon!
Give me some cash out, baby
Give me some cash out, baby




You gotta help me out

That's what you get, baby
Shake the glitter, shake, shake, shake the glitter, c'mon!
Give me some cash out, baby
Give me some cash out, baby



Comparisons are easily done
Once you've had a taste of perfection
Like an apple hanging from a tree
I picked the ripest one
I still got the seed

You said move on
Where do I go?
I guess second best
Is all I will know

'Cause when I'm with him
I am thinking of you
Thinking of you
What you would do if
You were the one
Who was spending the night
Oh I wish that I
Was looking into your eyes

You're like an Indian summer
In the middle of winter
Like a hard candy
With a surprise center
How do I get better
Once I've had the best?
You said there's
Tons of fish in the water
So the waters I will test

He kissed my lips
I taste your mouth
He pulled me in
I was disgusted with myself

'Cause when I'm with him
I am thinking of you
Thinking of you
What you would do if
You were the one
Who was spending the night
Oh I wish that I
Was looking into...

You're the best
And yes I do regret
How I could let myself
Let you go
Now, now the lesson's learned
I touched it I was burned
Oh I think you should know

'Cause when I'm with him
I am thinking of you
Thinking of you
What you would do if
You were the one
Who was spending the night
Oh I wish that I
Was looking into your eyes
Looking into your eyes
Looking into your eyes
Oh won't you walk through
And bust in the door
And take me away
Oh no more mistakes
'Cause in your eyes I'd like to stay... stay.

[Verse 1]
I hope you hang yourself with your H&M scarf
While jacking off listening to Mozart
You bitch and moan about LA
Wishing you were in the rain reading Hemingway 
You don’t eat meat
And drive electrical cars
You’re so indie rock it’s almost an art
You need SPF 45 just to stay alive

[CHORUS]
You’re so gay and you don’t even like boys
No you don’t even like
No you don’t even like 
No you don’t even like boys
You’re so gay and you don’t even like boys
No you don’t even like
No you don’t even like 
No you don’t even like…

[Verse 2]
You’re so sad maybe you should buy a happy meal
You’re so skinny you should really Super Size the deal
Secretly you’re so amused
That nobody understands you
I’m so mean cause I cannot get you outta your head
I’m so angry cause you’d rather MySpace instead
I can’t believe I fell in love with someone that wears more makeup than…

[CHORUS]
You’re so gay and you don’t even like boys
No you don’t even like
No you don’t even like 
No you don’t even like boys
You’re so gay and you don’t even like boys
No you don’t even like

You walk around like you’re oh so debonair
You pull ‘em down and there’s really nothing there
I wish you would just be real with me

You change your mind
Like a girl changes clothes.
Yeah, you, PMS
Like a bitch
I would know
And you over think
Always speak
Cryptically

I should know
That you're no good for me

[Chorus:]
'Cause you're hot then you're cold
You're yes then you're no
You're in then you're out
You're up then you're down
You're wrong when it's right
It's black and it's white
We fight, we break up
We kiss, we make up
(You) You don't really wanna stay, no
(You) But you don't really wanna go-o
You're hot then you're cold
You're yes then you're no
You're in then you're out
You're up then you're down

We used to be
Just like twins
So in sync
The same energy
Now's a dead battery
Used to laugh 'bout nothing
Now you're plain boring

I should know that
You're not gonna change

[Chorus]

Someone call the doctor
Got a case of a love bipolar
Stuck on a roller coaster
And I can't get off this ride

You change your mind
Like a girl changes clothes

'Cause you're hot then you're cold
You're yes then you're no
You're in then you're out
You're up then you're down
You're wrong when it's right
It's black and it's white
We fight, we break up
We kiss, we make up

You're hot then you're cold
You're yes then you're no
You're in then you're out
You're up then you're down
You're wrong when it's right
It's black and it's white
We fight, we break up
We kiss, we make up
(You) You don't really wanna stay, no
(You) But you don't really wanna go-o
You're hot then you're cold
You're yes then you're no
You're in then you're out
You're up then you're down, down...






If you want me, a cherry on top, the pick of the peck,
The crème de la crop.
If you want me you better do better than that tonight.
Oh, Oh.
If you want me, it takes more than a wink,
And more than a drink and more than you think.
If you want me you're gonna have to break the bank, tonight.
Cause some don't have the patience, some call me high-maintenance
But you pay the bill, cause, that's the deal.

If you wanna ride, just name your price don't play cheap, with your heart
Don't make a bet if you can't write the check, for me, for me.
Cause I can be bought, but you'll pay the cost
If you can afford me

If you want me, I'm not a piece of ass, a one night stand, a storage shed
I think you better walk by, tonight
Oh, no.
If you want me, then stop begging I don't put out for charity
If you want me there's no discount price tonight
But I don't need your dollar bills I just want something real
Cause, nothing's free, except a lovin' me

If you wanna ride, just name your price don't play cheap, with your heart
Don't make a bet if you can't write the check, for me, for me.
Cause I can be bought, but you'll pay the cost
If you can afford me

If you want me, a cherry on top,
The pick of the peck, the crème de la crop

If you wanna ride, just name your price don't play cheap, with your heart
Don't make a bet if you can't write the check, for me, for me.
Cause I can be bought, but you'll pay the cost
If you can afford -

If you wanna ride, just name your price don't play cheap, with your heart
Don't make a bet if you can't write the check, for me, for me.
Cause I can be bought, but you'll pay the cost
If you can afford me



[Verse 1]
I'm out on my own again
Face down in the porcelain
Feeling so high but looking so low
Party favors on the floor
Group of girls banging on the door
So many new fair-weather friends ooo:

[CHORUS]
Have you ever been so lost
Known the way and still so lost

[Verse 2]
Caught in the eye of a hurricane
Slowly waving goodbye like a pageant parade
So sick of this town pulling me down
My mother says I should come back home but
Can't find the way cause the way is gone
So if I pray am I just sending words into outer space

[CHORUS]
Have you ever been so lost
Known the way and still so lost
Another night waiting for someone to take me home
Have you ever been so lost

[BRIDGE]
Is there a light
Is there a light
At the end of the road
I'm pushing everyone away
'Cause I can't feel this anymore
Can't feel this anymore

[CHORUS]
Have you ever been so lost
Known the way and still so lost
Another night waiting for someone to take me home
Have you ever been so lost
Have you ever been so LOST.

 Remember when I dove into the crowd
And I got a bloody knee under my skin, a mark from wiping out
It brings back the memories
Every bone's been broken
But my heart is still wide open

[Chorus:]
I can't stop
Don't care if I lose
Baby you are the weapon I choose
These wounds are self inflicted
I'm going down in flames for you
Baby you are the weapon I choose
These wounds are self inflicted
One more thing I'm addicted too

With each scar there's a map that tells a story
what a souvenir of Young love's like jumping out
An airplane riding a tidal wave on an ocean of emotion
My heart rips me wide open

[Chorus]

And I cover up these scars
(We'll make it we'll make it but we break it)
And I can't stop seeing stars
(lets hope not die)
Whenever you're around
Around

[Chorus]

I can't stop no I can't stop
no I can't stop
Oh I'm going out in flames
Oh I'm going down in flames
Oh
Baby you are the weapon I choose
Baby you are the weapon I choose...





I leave the gas on
Walk the alleys in the dark
Sleep with candles burning
I leave the door unlocked
I'm weaving a rope and
Running all the red lights
Did I get your attention
'Cause I'm sending
All the signs that
The clock is ticking
And I'll be giving
My two weeks

Pick your favorite
Shade of black
You'd best
Prepare a speech
Say something funny
Say something sweet
But don't say
That you loved me

[Chorus:]
'cause I'm still breathing
But we've been
Dead for awhile
This sickness has no cure
We're going down for sure
Already lost our grip
Best abandon ship

Maybe I was too pale
Maybe I was too fat
Maybe you had better
Better luck in the sack
No formal education
And I swore way too much
But I swear
You didn't fucking care
'Cause we were in love

So as I write this letter
And shed my last tear
It's all for the better
That we end this here
Let's close this chapter
Say one last prayer
But don't say
That you loved me

[Chorus]

I'm still breathing
But we've been
Dead for awhile
This sickness has no cure
We're going down for sure
Already lost a grip
Best abandon ship






Voted most likely to end up on the back of a milk box drink
Looks like I'm letting them down
Cause seven, seventy-five isn't worth an hour of my hard work and time
When you can't afford half the shit they advertise
Oh I'm worth more then they ask for then the toe-tag generation full of regret
Oh I won't settle no, oh I can't settle

I wanna break the mold, I wanna break the stereotype
Fist in the air I'm not going down with out a fight
It's my life and I'm not sitting on the sidelines watching
It pass me by
I'm leaving you my legacy
I gotta make my mark
I gotta run it hard
I want you to remember me
I'm leaving my fingerprints
I'm leaving my fingerprints
I'm leaving my fingerprints on you

Representing you and me
Don't you wanna go down in history?
Rather then end up begging on the streets
Trading under table favors for a place to sleep
Cause I'm worth more then this so stop writing prescriptions for my Ritalin
I can't focus my attention

I wanna break the mold, I wanna break the stereotype
Fist in the air I'm not going down with out a fight
It's my life and I'm not sitting on the sidelines watching
It pass me by
I'm leaving you my legacy
I gotta make my mark
I gotta run it hard
I want you to remember me
I'm leaving my fingerprints
I'm leaving my fingerprints
Don't give up
Don't give in
Build your house on the rock
Oh not in the sand, in the sand, in the sand

It's my life and I'm not sitting on the sidelines watching
It pass me by
I'm leaving you my legacy
I gotta make my mark
I gotta run it hard
I want you to remember me
(I want you to remember me)
It's my life and I'm not sitting on the sidelines watching
It pass me by
I'm leaving you my legacy
I gotta make my mark
I gotta run it hard
I want you to remember me
Cause I'm leaving my fingerprints
I'm leaving my fingerprints
I'm leaving my fingerprints, in the end






I'm used to opening my own doors and splitting the checks
He introduced me, was always just a friend
I bought a new dress, he never noticed
Always falling for these bad boys, such a challenge
I'm getting tired, of cleaning up after them
I think I'm ready to be a woman

Oh love, I think I'm ready
Ready for it

You were such a surprise
An unexpected gift
Said I was pretty, and I believed it
Not really used to all this attention
Told myself I don't deserve you
And this is just a phase
Could I get used to, being loved the right way?
I wanna argue, but there is nothing to say

Oh love, I think I'm ready
Ready for it
Ready for it
Oh love, I think I'm ready

Cuz you send me flowers, when there's no occasion
Yeah we talk for hours, you still wanna listen
Won't hold it against me if I just need you to hold me tonight
My mother always told me that you'd show up one day
So scared to feel this way but love, I think I'm ready
Ready for it
Ready for it
Oh love, I think I'm ready
Ready for it
Ready for it
Oh love, I think I'm ready





I take these turns 
A bit too fast 
Trying to leave you 
In my past 
The CD skips 
Our favorite songs 
Our greatest hits 
Just don't belong 

I really love 
To hate this 
Love hate 
Hate love relationships 
Are over-rated 
Over my dead body 
Is how this will end 
He said it's over 
And I could go for 
Another chance to do 
This over again 

So this is it? 
After all 
We've been thru 
We call it quits 
And-a I'm about to 
Wash my prints 
Oh 
The little I had left 
He said it's over 
And I could really go 
For a cup of coffee 
And an overdose 

Leave it all behind me 
You'll see it 
When you finally find me 
Comatose or pretty close 
Cover up copy 
And an overdose 

I pop these pills 
Like cracker jacks 
And the price 
That plays dice 
Just watching you react 
When your depressed you 
Sleep too much 
I'm not sure 
If I'm waking up 

It's over-rated 
Over my dead body 
Is how this will end 
You said it'd over 
And I could go 
For another chance to do 
This over again 

So this is it? 
After all 
We've been thru 
We call it quits 
And-a i'm about 
To wash my prints 
Oh 
The little I had left 
He said it's over 
And I could really go 
For a cup of coffee 
And an overdose 

Leave it all behind me 
You'll see it 
When you finally find me 
Comatose or pretty close 
Cup of coffee 
And an overdose 

He said it's over 
And I could really go 
For a cup of coffee 
And an overdose 
Leave it all behind me 
You'll see it 
When you finally find me 
Comatose or pretty close 

I stood in line 
Without you 
I stood in line 
Without you 
And I don't tell you 
What it is 
I thought about you 
Well without you 
Is everything I've got





You think I'm pretty
Without any makeup on
You think I'm funny
When I tell the punchline wrong
I know you get me
So I let my walls come down, down

Before you met me
I was alright but things
Were kinda heavy
You brought me to life
Now every February
You'll be my Valentine, Valentine

Let's go all the way tonight
No regrets, just love
We can dance, until we die
You and I, will be young forever

[Chorus:]
You make me feel
Like I'm livin' a
Teenage dream
The way you turn me on
I can't sleep
Let's run away and
Don't ever look back,
Don't ever look back

My heart stops
When you look at me
Just one touch
Now baby I believe
This is real
So take a chance and
Don't ever look back,
Don't ever look back

We drove to Cali
And got drunk on the beach
Got a motel and
Built a fort out of sheets
I finally found you
My missing puzzle piece
I'm complete

Let's go all the way tonight
No regrets, just love
We can dance, until we die
You and I, will be young forever

[Chorus:]
You make me feel
Like I'm livin' a
Teenage dream
The way you turn me on
I can't sleep
Let's run away and
Don't ever look back,
Don't ever look back

My heart stops
When you look at me
Just one touch
Now baby I believe
This is real
So take a chance and
Don't ever look back,
Don't ever look back

I'mma get your heart racing
In my skin-tight jeans
Be your teenage dream tonight
Let you put your hands on me
In my skin-tight jeans
Be your teenage dream tonight

[Chorus:]
Yoooouuu
You make me feel
Like I'm livin' a
Teenage dream
The way you turn me on
I can't sleep
Let's run away and
Don't ever look back,
Don't ever look back
No

My heart stops
When you look at me
Just one touch
Now baby I believe
This is real
So take a chance and
Don't ever look back,
Don't ever look back

I'mma get your heart racing
In my skin-tight jeans
Be your teenage dream tonight
Let you put your hands on me
In my skin-tight jeans
Be your teenage dream tonight
(Tonight, tonight, tonight, tonight, tonight, tonight)






There's a stranger in my bed,
There's a pounding in my head
Glitter all over the room
Pink flamingos in the pool
I smell like a minibar
DJ's passed out in the yard
Barbie's on the barbeque
This a hickie or a bruise

Pictures of last night
Ended up online
I'm screwed
Oh well
It's a blacked out blur
But I'm pretty sure it ruled
Damn

Last Friday night
Yeah, we danced on tabletops
And we took too many shots
Think we kissed but I forgot

Last Friday night
Yeah, we maxed our credit cards
And got kicked out of the bar
So we hit the boulevard

Last Friday night
We went streaking in the park
Skinny dipping in the dark
Then had a ménage à trois
Last Friday night
Yeah I think we broke the law
Always say we're gonna stop
Op-oh-oh

This Friday night
Do it all again
This Friday night
Do it all again

Trying to connect the dots
Don't know what to tell my boss
Think the city towed my car
Chandelier is on the floor
Ripped my favorite party dress
Warrant's out for my arrest
Think I need a ginger ale
That was such an epic fail

Pictures of last night
Ended up online
I'm screwed
Oh well
It's a blacked out blur
But I'm pretty sure it ruled
Damn

Last Friday night
Yeah, we danced on table tops
And we took too many shots
Think we kissed but I forgot

Last Friday night
Yeah, we maxed our credit cards
And got kicked out of the bar
So we hit the boulevard

We went streaking in the park
Skinny dipping in the dark
Then had a ménage à trois

Last Friday night
Yeah I think we broke the law
Always say we're gonna stop
Oh whoa oh

This Friday night
Do it all again
(Do it all again)
This Friday night
Do it all again
(Do it all again)
This Friday night

T.G.I.F.
T.G.I.F.
T.G.I.F.
T.G.I.F.
T.G.I.F.
T.G.I.F.

Last Friday night
Yeah, we danced on table tops

Do it all again

[Clapping] Whohoo!







[Snoop Dogg:]
Greetings loved ones
Let's take a journey

[Katy:]
I know a place
Where the grass is really greener
Warm, wet and wild
There must be something in the water
Sippin' gin and juice
Laying underneath the palm trees (undone)
The boys break their necks
Tryna creep a little sneak peek (at us)

You could travel the world
But nothing comes close
To the golden coast
Once you party with us
You'll be falling in love
Oooooh Oh Oooooh

California girls
We're unforgettable
Daisy Dukes
Bikinis on top
Sun-kissed skin

We'll melt your popsicle

Do you ever feel like a plastic bag
Drifting through the wind, wanting to start again?
Do you ever feel, feel so paper thin
Like a house of cards, one blow from caving in?

Do you ever feel already buried deep six feet under?
Screams but no one seems to hear a thing
Do you know that there's still a chance for you
'Cause there's a spark in you?

You just gotta ignite the light and let it shine
Just own the night like the 4th of July

'Cause, baby, you're a firework
Come on, show 'em what you're worth
Make 'em go, "Aah, aah, aah"
As you shoot across the sky-y-y

Baby, you're a firework
Come on, let your colours burst
Make 'em go, "Aah, aah, aah"
You're gonna leave 'em all in awe, awe, awe

You don't have to feel like a wasted space
You're original, cannot be replaced
If you only knew what the future holds
After a hurricane comes a rainbow

Maybe a reason why all the doors are closed
So you could open one that leads you to the perfect road
Like a lightning bolt, your heart will glow
And when it's time you'll know

You just gotta ignite the light and let it shine
Just own the night like the 4th of July

'Cause, baby, you're a firework
Come on, show 'em what you're worth
Make 'em go, "Aah, aah, aah"
As you shoot across the sky-y-y

Baby, you're a firework
Come on, let your colours burst
Make 'em go, "Aah, aah, aah"
You're gonna leave 'em all in awe, awe, awe

Boom, boom, boom
Even brighter than the moon, moon, moon
It's always been inside of you, you, you
And now it's time to let it through-ough-ough

'Cause, baby, you're a firework
Come on, show 'em what you're worth
Make 'em go, "Aah, aah, aah"
As you shoot across the sky-y-y

Baby, you're a firework
Come on, let your colours burst
Make 'em go, "Aah, aah, aah"
You're gonna leave 'em all in awe, awe, awe

Boom, boom, boom
Even brighter than the moon, moon, moon
Boom, boom, boom
Even brighter than the moon, moon, moon

This is the last time you say,
After the last line you break,
It's not even a holiday,
Nothing to celebrate.
You give a hundred reasons why,
And you say you're really gonna try.
If I had a nickel for everytime,
I'd own the bank.

Thought that I was the exception,
I could have rewrite your addiction,
You could've been the greatest,
But you'd rather get wasted.

You fall asleep during foreplay,
'Cause the pills you take, are more your forte.
I'm not sticking around to watch you go down.
Wanna be your lover, not your fucking' mother.
Can't be your savior, I don't have the power.
I'm not gonna stay and watch you circle the drain,
Watch you circle the drain,
Watch you circle the drain.

You say you have to write your rhymes,
Whatever helps you sleep at night
You've become what you despise,
A stereotype
You think you're so rock and roll,
But you're really just a joke.
Had the world in the palm of your hands,
But you fucking choked
Should've been my team mate,
Could've changed your fate,
You say that you love me,
You won't remember in the morning.

You fall asleep during foreplay,
'Cause the pills you take, are more your forte.
I'm not sticking around to watch you go down.
Wanna be your lover, not your fucking mother.
Can't be your savior, I don't have the power.
I'm not gonna stay and watch you circle the drain,
Watch you circle the drain,
Watch you circle the drain.

You fall asleep during foreplay,
'Cause the pills you take, are more your forte.
I'm not sticking around to watch you go down.
Wanna be your lover, not your fucking mother.
Can't be your savior, I don't have the power.
I'm not gonna stay and watch you circle the drain,
Watch you circle the drain,
Watch you circle the drain.
Watch you circle the drain,
Watch you circle the drain.
You fall asleep during foreplay,
'Cause the pills you take, are more your forte.
I'm not sticking around to watch you go down.






Summer after high school when we first met
We'd make out in your Mustang to Radiohead
And on my 18th Birthday
We got matching tattoos

Used to steal your parents' liquor
And climb to the roof
Talk about our future
Like we had a clue
Never planned that one day
I'd be losing you

In another life
I would be your girl
We'd keep all our promises
Be us against the world

In another life
I would make you stay
So I don't have to say
You were the one that got away
The one that got away

I was June and you were my Johnny Cash
Never one without the other, we made a pact
Sometimes when I miss you
I put those records on (Whoa)

Someone said you had your tattoo removed
Saw you downtown singing the Blues
It's time to face the music
I'm no longer your muse

But in another life
I would be your girl
We'd keep all our promises
Be us against the world

In another life
I would make you stay
So I don't have to say
You were the one that got away
The one that got away
The o-o-o-o-o-one [x3]
The one that got away

[Bridge:]
All this money can't buy me a time machine (Nooooo)
Can't replace you with a million rings (Nooooo)
I should've told you what you meant to me (Whoa)
'Cause now I pay the price

In another life
I would be your girl
We'd keep all our promises
Be us against the world

In another life
I would make you stay
So I don't have to say
You were the one that got away
The one that got away
The o-o-o-o-o-one [x3]

In another life
I would make you stay
So I don't have to say
You were the one that got away
The one that got away





You're so hypnotizing
Could you be the devil?
Could you be an angel?

Your touch magnetizing
Feels like I am floating
Leaves my body glowing

They say, be afraid
You're not like the others
Futuristic lover
Different DNA
They don't understand you

[Pre-Chorus]
You're from a whole 'nother world
A different dimension
You open my eyes
And I'm ready to go
Lead me into the light

Kiss me, ki-ki-kiss me
Infect me with your love and
Fill me with your poison

Take me, ta-ta-take me
Wanna be a victim
Ready for abduction

Boy, you're an alien
Your touch so foreign
It's supernatural
Extraterrestrial

[Verse 2]
You're so supersonic
Wanna feel your powers
Stun me with your lasers
Your kiss is cosmic
Every move is magic

[Pre-Chorus]
You're from a whole 'nother world
A different dimension
You open my eyes
And I'm ready to go
Lead me into the light

[Chorus]
Kiss me, ki-ki-kiss me
Infect me with your love and
Fill me with your poison

Take me, ta-ta-take me
Wanna be a victim
Ready for abduction

Boy, you're an alien
Your touch so foreign
It's supernatural
Extraterrestrial

[Bridge]
This is transcendental
On another level
Boy, you're my lucky star

I wanna walk on your wave length
And be there when you vibrate
For you I'll risk it all
All

[Chorus]
Kiss me, ki-ki-kiss me
Infect me with your love and
Fill me with your poison

Take me, ta-ta-take me
Wanna be a victim
Ready for abduction

Boy, you're an alien
Your touch so foreign
It's supernatural
Extraterrestrial

Extraterrestrial
Extraterrestrial

Boy, you're an alien
Your touch so foreign
It's supernatural
Extraterrestrial





Yeah eh yeah yeah

I can feel a phoenix inside of me
As I march alone to a different beat
Slowly swallowing down my fear, yeah yeah

I am ready for the road less traveled
Suiting up for my crowning battle
This test is my own cross to bare
But I will get there

It's never easy to be chosen, never easy to be called
Standing on the frontline when the bombs start to fall
I can see the heavens but I still hear the flames
Calling out my name

I can see the writing on the wall
I can't ignore this war
At the eh-end of it all
Who am I living for?

I can feel this light that's inside of me
Growing fast into a bolt of lightning
I know one spark will shock the world, yeah yeah

So I pray for a favour like Esther
I need your strength to handle the pressure
I know there will be sacrifice
But that's the price

It's never easy to be chosen, never easy to be called
Standing on the frontline when the bombs start to fall
I can see the heavens but I still hear the flames
Calling out my name

I can see the writing on the wall
I can't ignore this war
At the eh-end of it all
Who am I living for?

I can see the writing on the wall
I can't ignore this war
At the eh-end of it all
Who am I living for?

At the end, at the end
Who am I living for?
At the end, at the end
Who am I living for?

Heavy is the head that wears the crown
Don't let the greatness get you down
Heavy is the head that wears the crown
Don't let the greatness get you down, oh, oh yeah

I can see the writing on the wall
I can't ignore this war
At the eh-end of it all
Who am I living for?

I can see the writing on the wall
I can't ignore this war
At the eh-end of it all
Who am I living for?

At the end, at the end
Who am I living for?
At the end, at the end
Who am I living for?





She is a pyramid
But with him she's just a grain of sand
This love's too strong like mice and men
Squeezing out the life that should be let in

She was a hurricane-cane-cane-cane
But now she's just a gust of wind
She used to set the sails of a thousand ships
Was a force to be reckoned with

She could be a statue of liberty
She could be a Joan of Arc
But he's scared of the light that's inside of her
So he keeps her in the dark

Oh, she used to be a pearl...Oh
Yeah, she used to rule the world...Oh
Can't believe she's become a shell of herself
'Cause she used to be a pearl

She was unstoppable
Moved fast just like an avalanche
But now she's stuck deep in cement
Wishing that they'd never ever met

She could be a statue of liberty
She could be a Joan of Arc
But he's scared of the light that's inside of her
So he keeps her in the dark

Oh, she used to be a pearl...Oh
Yeah, she used to rule the world...Oh
Can't believe she's become a shell of herself
'Cause she used to be a—

Do you know that there's a way out,
there's a way out
there's a way out
there's a way out

You don't have to be held down,
be held down
be held down
be held down

'Cause I used to be a shell
Yeah, I let him rule my world
my world, oh, yeah

But I woke up and grew strong
And I can still go on
And no one can take my pearl

You don't have to be a shell, no
YoU'RE THE ONE THAT RULES YOUR WORLD, OH
You are strong and you'll learn
that you can still go on

And you'll always be a—a pearl

She is unstoppable




I saw you at the grocery store
Oh, you both looked happy
Picking out the usual
She's a carbon copy
Of everything you lost
Of everything I'm not
I guess you forgot
How to pick 'em

If she's the one I've heard about
I'm disappointed
If she's the reason why you left
I'm not impressed at all
Well, this looks like the end
Yeah, we can still be friends
Congratulations

Let me be the first
To wish you the worst
'Cause I think you deserve each other
Let me be the curse
That creeps under your skin
Until your heart caves in
And you wish she was me

Again
And again
And again
And again

Someone had to tell the truth
And I'm always honest
I read you like an open book
And it's obvious to me
She's just the one between
Heading nowhere fast
Sure it's gonna last
Forever

Let me be the first
To wish you the worst
'Cause I think you deserve each other
Let me be the curse
That creeps under your skin
Until your heart caves in
And you wish she was me

Let me be the first
To wish you the worst
'Cause I think you deserve each other
Let me be the curse
That creeps under your skin
Until your heart caves in
And you wish she was me

Again
And again

Oh
You wish
You wish
You wish




I know you know my boyfriend is out of town
So have a drink, let's talk it over
So many things I shouldn't be sayin' now
You know, I like my boys a little bit older

I just wanna use your love
Tonight, tonight, tonight, tonight, tonight
I don't wanna lose your love tonight

All my girls are nowhere to be found
They all split when I'm in trouble
But I'll tell you all my secrets if you stick around
The undercover lovers under the covers

I just wanna use your love
Tonight, tonight, tonight, tonight, tonight
I don't wanna lose your love tonight

I just wanna use your lo-uh-ove, lo-uh-ove
I just wanna use your lo-uh-ove, lo-uh-ove
I just wanna use your lo-uh-ove, lo-uh-ove, lo-uh-uh-uh-ove

Trying to stop my head from spinning 
Too much to drink, not making sense
It's been a while since I've been with someone new
That I can't stop the way I'm feeling

As you leave, please could you just close the door
Now that our love affair is over
You're exactly what I was looking for
We'll find a shoulder to cry upon

I just wanna use your love
Tonight, tonight, tonight, tonight, tonight
I don't wanna lose your love tonight
I just wanna use your love 
(Oh, I just wanna use your love, baby)
Tonight, tonight, tonight, tonight, tonight
I don't wanna lose your love tonight
I just wanna use your love
(Oh, I just wanna use your love now baby)
Tonight, tonight, tonight, tonight, tonight
I don't wanna lose your love tonight
(You don't mean nothing at all to me)
(You don't mean nothing at all to me)
I just wanna use your love
(You don't mean nothing at all to me)
Tonight, tonight, tonight, tonight, tonight
(You don't mean nothing at all to me)
I don't wanna lose your love tonight
(You don't mean nothing at all)

I think I'm done fuckin' a singin' this song, song
I think I'm done fuckin' a singin' this song, song
I think I'm done fuckin' a singin' this song
Singin' this song song song song song







[B.o.B]
You know it's crazy, 'cause nights like this
Would start out with a little private party
You sneak me in your mom's house
I know I mighta spilled my drink, but
Really wasn't tryin' to spill my heart out
I mean it started as a conversation
I was really tryin' to get my thoughts out
But then we make moves and we make plans
Had the whole thing mapped out
See, you were gonna go to college
And to pay for bills I'd figure the job out
And you knew I had to say it, but them day's gone
Now I moved on and you switched phones
Hopefully reincarnation will bring us back to the place we belong

[Katy Perry]
Summer after high school when we first met
We make out in your Mustang to Radiohead
And on my 18th birthday we got matching tattoos

Used to steal your parents' liquor and climb to the roof
Talk about our future like we had a clue
Never planned that one day, I'd be losing you

In another life
I would be your girl
We keep all our promises
Be us against the world

In another life
I would make you stay
So I don't have to say
You were the one that got away
The one that got away

I was June and you were my Johnny Cash
Never one without the other we made a pact
Sometimes when I miss you
I put those records on

Someone said you had your tattoo removed
Saw you downtown singing the blues
Its time to face the music
I'm no longer your muse

In another life
I would be your girl
We keep all our promises
Be us against the world

In another life
I would make you stay
So I don't have to say
You were the one that got away
The one that got away
The o-o-o-o-o-one [x3]
The one that got away

[B.o.B]
I'm falling for you like dominoes
From the top of the hundredth floor
Look out below Geronimo
Tryin' to get behind the closed doors to your soul
Why'd you have to end the show
We had such a beautiful plot
There was still more story to go
Now look, I'm not insinuating that
You're some type of fair weather player
But even if the whole world falls over
I wouldn't be aware of a glacier
I just wanna see you wake up
Doing your hair in the mirror with your makeup
Then, maybe in the next lifetime we could make up

[Katy Perry]
In another life
I would be your girl
We keep all our promises
Be us against the world

In another life
I would make you stay
So I don't have to say
You were the one that got away
The one that got away
The o-o-o-o-o-one [x3]

In another life
I would make you stay
So I don't have to say
You were the one that got away
The one that got away





You're such a poet
I wish I could be Wesley Willis
My words would flow like honey, sweet and laid on thick
You're so edgy
You dont even need a rhyming dictionary
I wipe my hands on your jeans, 'cause they are more distressed
So they say--you got O.C.D.
And they claim you can barely read
But you say "Don't bother me with all of your reality"

But it could be so simple 
(you were thinking)
Life should be that simple
(Who would have thought it)
I wish it were just so simple
(don't know what you were thinking)
But the point's been missed
You've made a mess
Who would have guessed
That it's as simple as it seems

So what, you're a genius
But you've got a lot to learn
Like the time you lost your apartment
Cause you bought too much Vuitton
You park in a loading zone
You sleep with the lights all on
You cross your i's and dot your t's
All it goes to show

That it could be so simple 
(you were thinking)
Life should be that simple
(Who would have thought it)
I wish it were just that simple
(don't know what you were thinking)
The point's been missed
We've made a mess
Who would have guessed
That it's as simple as it seems

I'm not saying that it's a piece of cake
Just take a moment to re-evaluate
The possibilities
The situations
The opportunities
That are waiting
Oh, the possibilities
Oh, I

It could, it could be that simple
(you were thinking)
Life should be that simple
(Who would have thought it)
I wish it were just so simple
(don't know what you were thinking)
You're in a haze
It's just a phase
You know this maze
Is as simple as it seems

We could talk all day
About your eccentricities
What I mean to say
Oh, is that I need you listen please
And focus on life's simplicities
So don't be afraid to strip it away
Cause at the end of the day
It's still as simple as it seems

It is all so simple
Just deal with it





The leaves were falling
I was seventeen
We'd been locking lips,
Grabbing hips,
Smoking cigarettes
We took a drive in your 1990
Had me down from out of town
I was California

Oh, my legs were not shaved
And you had dirt between your fingers
They told us to behave,
But hey,

It's not like riding a bike
It's not like flying a kite
It's not as easy as pie
There's nothing like the first time
It's not like taking a bath
It's not like having a laugh
It's not like reading a map
There's nothing like the first time

I had seen it in the magazines
We would change the channel on the T.V screen
'Cause it's such a sin what ya did to me
Straight to Hell,
Is what they sell if you've done the deed

Oh, but what could be so bad
Oh, if everyone is guilty
I guess we want what we can't have
'Cause I've heard,

It's not like riding a bike
It's not like flying a kite
It's not as easy as pie
There's nothing like the first time
It's not like taking a bath
It's not like having a laugh
It's not like reading a map
There's nothing like the first time

(Do you remember?)
(Do you remember?)
(Do you remember?)
(Do you remember?)

La la la
La la la
There's nothing like the first time
La la la 
La la la
There's nothing like the first time

It's not a walk in the park
It's not a shot in the dark
It's not a juvenile crime
There's nothing like the first time
It's not like tying the knot
There's no connecting the dots
And in case you forgot,
There's nothing like the first time

La la la
La la la
There's nothing like the first time
La la la
La la la 
There's nothing like the first time
La la la 
La la la 
There's nothing like the first time

It's not like reading a map,
Oh yeah, I can give you that
There's nothing like the first time

Cool as a cucumber you're coming on to me
You say you got the ripest melons on the street
My honeydew and your banana make a treat

But first comes, first serves, so bottoms up!

Because my sugar gonna give you cavities
Don't wanna share me cause I'm such a tasty treat (yummy)

I let you double dip it in your favorite sauce
I even let you eat the cherry on the top
You beg for seconds in a diabetic shock (what?)

This was big for us
Forever changing you and me
Allow me to be ambiguous
Though I can't stand ambiguity

I'll beat around this burning bush
Trying to put the fire out
When all the shoving came to push
The words just stayed stuck in my mouth

'Cause it's okay to believe in something
It's alright to live your live for someone
Ba da da dum
It's okay to believe in something
It's alright to live your live for someone, yeah
Ba da da dum

So we might lose
But I'm glad I didn't leave
I wear my soul on my shoes
If not my heart upon my sleeve

If I'm not allowed to speak aloud
Of what you really mean to me
Then'll type it bold when I spell it out
I T S L O V E

'Cause it's okay to believe in something
It's alright to live your live for someone, yeah
Ba da da dum, oh, oh, oh
It's okay to believe in something
It's alright to live your life for someone, yeah
Ba da da dum, oh

So why do I hesitate for my cocoon to break?
Second guess every move that I make
(Second guess every move that you make)

This was big for us
Changing you and me

'Cause it's okay to believe in something
It's alright to live your live for someone, yeah
Oh, oh yeah
Oh, it's okay to believe in something
It's alright to live your live for someone, yeah
Ba da da dum

Oh, somebody tell me
It's okay to believe in something
It's alright to live your life for someone, yeah
Ba da da dum

Stand up for what you believe in
Take pride for who you are
Yeah, yeah, oh yeah

Stand up for what you believe in
Take pride for who you are
Yeah, yeah

Stand up for what you believe in
Take pride for who you are
Yeah, yeah








You come over, don't talk
Turn the TV on, off 
Disconnected, unaffected 
Better take the call

Showed you pictures of my hometown 
A pin could drop from miles down 
What's the use in trying to be a girlfriend
When I know just what we are

There's nothing in common
Except the bed we lay on

I won't be caught between something and nothing
When you know that nothing is for free
'Cause in the end it's me who pulls the covers
And it's empty in between

You're a habit I can't break
Disaster to eliminate
What part of "no" do I not understand?
When you're not good for me

'Cause I know we will never
Be some kind of forever

I won't be caught between something and nothing
When you know that nothing is for free
'Cause in the end it's me who pulls the covers
And it's empty in between

'Cause I'm the girl who needs it all or nothing
How did we become a one-night-stand?
Hanging on a thread just isn't something
That I want in the end, no

Oh, it's empty in between

You come over
Yeah, it's over 
Oh, we know just what we are

I won't be caught between something and nothing
When you know that nothing is for free
'Cause in the end it's me who pulls the covers
And it's empty in between

'Cause I'm the girl who needs it all or nothing
How did we become a one-night-stand?
Hanging on a thread just isn't something
That I want in the end, no

Oh, it's empty in between






Oh, sweetheart, put the bottle down
You've got too much talent
I see you through those bloodshot eyes
There's a cure, you've found it

Slow motion, sparks you caught that chill
Now don't deny it
But boys will be boys oh, yes they will
They don't want to define it
Just give up the game and get into me
If you're looking for thrills, then get cold feet

Oh no, I do not hook up, up
I go slow, so if you want me
I don't come cheap
Keep your thing in your pants
And your heart on your sleeve

Oh no, I do not hook up, up
I fall deep
'Cause the more that you try
The harder I'll fight
To say goodnight

I can't cook, no but I can clean
Up the mess you left
Lay your head down
And feel the beat as I kiss

Your forehead, this may not last
But this is now
So love the one you're with
You wanna chase
But you're chasing your tail
Quick fix won't ever get you well

Oh no, I do not hook up, up
I go slow, so if you want me
I don't come cheap
Keep your thing in your pants
And your heart on your sleeve

Oh no, I do not hook up, up
I fall deep
'Cause the more that you try
The harder I'll fight
To say goodnight

'Cause I feel the distance between us
Could be over with a snap of your fingers
Oh, oh, oh, yeah

Oh no, I do not hook up, up
I go slow, so if you want me
I don't come cheap
Keep your thing in your pants
And your heart on your sleeve

Oh no, I do not hook up, up
I fall deep
'Cause the more that you try
The harder I'll fight
To say goodnight

Oh, sweetheart
Put the bottle down
'Cause you don't
Wanna miss out







I wanted to be with you alone
And talk about the weather
But traditions I can trace against the child in your face
Won't escape my attention

You keep your distance with a system of touch
And gentle persuasion
I'm lost in admiration, could I need you this much?
Oh, you're wasting my time
Oh, just, just, just wasting time

Something happens and I'm head over heels
I never find out 'till I'm head over heels
Something happens and I'm head over heels
Oh, don't take my heart
Don't break my heart
Don't, don't, don't throw it away

Throw it away
Throw it away

I made a fire and I'm watching it burn
Thought of your future
With one foot in the past now just how long will it last
No, no, no, have you no ambitions?

My mother and my brothers used to breathing clean air
And dreaming I'm a doctor
It's hard to be a man when there's a gun in your hand
Oh, I feel so...

Something happens and I'm head over heels
I never find out 'till I'm head over heels
Something happens and I'm head over heels
Oh, don't take my heart
Don't break my heart
Don't, don't, don't throw it away

And this is my four-leaf clover
I'm on the line
One open mind
This is my four-leaf clover

Nanananana...

Funny how times flies

Funny how times flies




You make me feel like I'm losing my virginity
The first time every time when you touch me
I make you bloom like a flower that you never seen
Under the sun we are one buzzing energy

Let's pollinate to create a family tree
This evolution with you comes naturally
Some call it science we call it chemistry
This is the story of the birds and the bees

Even the seasons change
Our love still stays the same

You give me the hummingbird heartbeat
Spread my wings and make me fly
The taste of your honey is so sweet
When you give me the hummingbird heartbeat, hummingbird heartbeat
Oh oh
Hummingbird heartbeat
Oh oh
Hummingbird heartbeat

I've flown a million miles just to find a magic seed
A white flower with the power to bring life to me
You're so exotic my whole body fluttering
Constantly craving for a taste of your sticky sweet

I was on the brink of a heart attack
You gave me life and keep me coming back
I see the sun rise in your eyes, your eyes
We've got a future full of blue skies, blue skies

Even the seasons change
Our love still stays the same

You give me the hummingbird heartbeat
Spread my wings and make me fly
The taste of your honey is so sweet
When you give me the hummingbird heartbeat, hummingbird heartbeat
Oh oh
Hummingbird heartbeat
Oh oh
Hummingbird heartbeat

You love me, you love me
Never love me not, not, oh no
When we hear a perfect harmony
You make me sound like, like a symphony

Spread my wings and make me fly
The taste of your honey is so sweet
When you give me the hummingbird heartbeat, hummingbird heartbeat

You give me the hummingbird heartbeat
Spread my wings and make me fly
The taste of your honey is so sweet
When you give me the hummingbird heartbeat, hummingbird heartbeat
Oh oh
Hummingbird heartbeat
Oh oh
Hummingbird heartbeat
Oh oh
Hummingbird heartbeat
Oh oh
Hummingbird heartbeat






He put it on me, I put it on,
Like there was nothing wrong.
It didn't fit,
It wasn't right.
Wasn't just the size.
They say you know,
When you know.
I don't know.

I didn't feel the fairytale feeling, no.
Am I a stupid girl for even dreaming that I could?

If it's not like the movies,
That's how it should be, yeah.
When he's the one,
I'll come undone,
And my world will stop spinning
And that's just the beginning, yeah.

Snowwhite said when I was young,
"One day my prince will come."
So I'll wait for that date.
They say it's hard to meet your match,
Gotta find my better half.
So we make perfect shapes.
If stars don't align,
If it doesn't stop time,
If you can't see the sign,
Wait for it.
One hundred percent,
Worth every penny spent.
He'll be the one that
Finishes your sentences.

If it's not like the movies,
That's how it should be, yeah.
When he's the one,
He'll come undone,
And my world will stop spinning,
And that's just the beginning, oh, yeah.

'Cause I know you're out there,
And you're, you're looking for me, oh.
It's a crazy idea that you were made perfectly for me
You'll see.

Just like the movies.
That's how it will be.
Cinematic and dramatic with the perfect ending, oh.

It's not like the movies, oh,
But that's how it should be, yeah.
When he's the one,
You'll come undone,
And your world will stop spinning,
And it's just the beginning.

I would be your girl
We'd keep all our promises
Be us against the world
In another life
I would make you stay
So I don't have to say
You were the one that got away
The one that got away

I was June and you were my Johnny Cash
Never one without the other, we made a pact
Sometimes when I miss you
I put those records on (Whoa)
Someone said you had your tattoo removed
Saw you downtown singing the Blues
It's time to face the music
I'm no longer your muse

[Chorus]

The one (the one) [x2]
Oh, the one, the one, the one, the one, the one
The one that got away

All this money can't buy me a time machine (No)
Can't replace you with a million rings (No)
I should've told you what you meant to me (Whoa)
'Cause now I pay the price

[Chorus]

The one

In another life
I would make you stay
So I don't have to say
You were the one that got away
The one that got away






I was living in a small mind 
With no lifeline 
And no messages can reach me from the outside 
When I looked out over the horizon 
Didn't notice the sun was setting or just rising 

Then it hit me 
Maybe bit me 
Then I knew, quite a few would not go with me 
I didn't know exactly where I would be going 
But I had to let this river in me flowing 

What a ride 
When you open your eyes 
For the very first time 
A real surprise 

I started living outside of the box 
Crossing over lines where I always used to stop 
Living outside of the box 
'Cause I'm not gonna be anybody that I'm not 
I always knew this day would come 
When I got off my back, found some motivation 
I've been living on the other side 
Come hell or high water every moment I'm alive 

I was living on a fault line 
The fault was all mine 
And this unstable ground found me down half the time 
But I had enough 
I had to get up 
I had to shrug it all off 'cause it's the same old stuff 

Then it hit me 
You won't permit me 
To be an individual 
Just doesn't fit me 
But I decided that it's going to be living 
Yeah, I decided I'm escaping from your prison 

What a high 
When you open your mind for the very first time 
A real surprise 

I started living outside of the box 
Crossing over lines where I always used to stop 
Living outside of the box 
'Cause I'm not gonna be anybody that I'm not 
I always knew this day would come 
When I got off my back, found some motivation 
I've been living on the other side 
Come hell or high water every moment I'm alive 

So long conformity 
And ambiguality is a new priority 
All it takes, for heaven sakes 
Is to figure out the face and learn to seperate 

I started living outside for the box 
Taking my time when I always used to rush 
Living outside of the box 
'Cause I'm not gonna be anybody that I'm not 
I always knew this day would come 
When I broke down the walls for my liberation 
I've been living on the other side 
Come hell or high water every moment I'm alive 

Oh, living outside of the box 
Oh, living outside of the box 
Oh, living outside 

Ha ha ha 

I always knew this day would come 
When I got off my back, found some motivation 

Oh, living outside of the box 
Of the box, of your life 
Of everything that seems that nice







The fish swan
Out of the ocean
And grew legs
And they started walking
And the apes climbed down
From the trees
And grew tall
And they started talking

And the stars
Fell out of the sky
And my tears
Rolled into the ocean
Now I'm looking
For a reason why
You even set my world
Into motion

'Cause if you're not
Really here
Then the stars
Don't even matter
Now I'm filled
To the top with fear
But it's all
Just a bunch of matter
'Cause if you're not
Really here
Then I don¡t want
To be either
I wanna be next to you
Black and gold
Black and gold
Black and gold

I looked up
Into de grey sky
And see a thousand eyes
Staring back
And all around
These golden beacons
I see nothing but black

I feel a way of something
Beyond them
I don't see
What I can feel
If vision
Is the only validation
Then most of my life
Isn't real

'Cause if you're not
Really here
Then the stars
Don't even matter
Now I'm filled
To the top with fear
But it's all
Just a bunch of matter
'Cause if you're not
Really here
Then I don't want
To be either
I wanna be next to you
Black and gold
Black and gold
Black and gold






The weight of my words
Are like feathers from a bird
My mouth, it moves
But you won't hear a thing

'Cause I've dug myself deep
I managed to fit both my hands and feet
All my little white lies
Smell like a big old bucket of bleach

In one ear and out your other
So lock and key
You won't open up for me

So brick by brick
I am breaking through these walls
Oh, between you and me
I'm not giving up, I'm not giving up

I guess
And it feels like you're in China
And I am in Peru
Whenever I am sleeping next to you

We can hear the crickets singing
Oh, all throughout the night
Oh, boy can't you just get used
To something so right?

And sure I confess
I'm a mess, I'm a mess of mistakes
But please count to ten
Before you go and throw it all away

So brick by brick
I am breaking through these walls
Oh, between you and me
I'm not giving up, I'm not giving up on us

'Cause if you give up
Then what am I supposed to do?
All our dreams
Never will come true without you

So brick by brick
I am breaking through these walls
Oh, between you and me
I'm not giving up, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
I'm not giving, giving, yeah, yeah, yeah
I'm not giving, giving, yeah, yeah, yeah

Oh baby, don't give up on this love







I wear the red shoes 
With the holes 
To remind me 
What we went through 
Sit down here 
Kick 'em off enough 
Not had enough of you 
I tell you 
You know 
The car you drive 
Keeps breaking down 
And never starts 
Next thing 
I'm pulling up to you 
We're in the backseat 
Driving it home 
No one wants 
To be alone 

[Chorus:]
What do you do? 
What do you do 
When everything 
Is broken? 
What do you say? 
What do you say 
When no words 
Fit the moment? 
'Cuz you're not here 
And even if you were 
All I could say 
Is what do I do? 
What do I do? 
We're broken 
But I can't 
Throw us away 

The video 
Of our vacation's 
Chewed up in the drawer 
Beside me 
She thinks I never got 
To watch it 
I'm so glad 
I made a copy 
The sky 
Got bitter twisted 
Just like you and me 
I miss it 
You snap it 
Bend it 
Burn it 
Then you find 
That you can't fix it 
Fall back on whatever 
Still remains 

[Chorus]

Breaking you in 
Breaking your heart 
I was taking it all 
And I tore you apart 
Breaking me in 
Breaking my heart 
And the damage was done 
But I took what you got 
We were breakin' it 
Smashin' it 
Takin' it 
Lovin' it 
Hatin' it 
Drivin' it home 
And now I'm all 
Now I'm all alone 

Oh, yeah [4x]

[Chorus]

What do I do? 
We're broken 
But I can't 
Throw us away








I used to know you when we were young
You were in all my dreams
We sat together in period one
Fridays at 8:15
Now I see face in the strangest places
Movies and magazines
I saw you talkin' to Christopher Walken
On my TV screen

But I will wait for you
As long as I need to
And if you ever get back to Hackensack
I'll be here for you

I used to work in a record store
Now I work for my dad
Scraping the paint off of hard wood floors
The hours are pretty bad
Sometimes I wonder where you are
Probably in L.A.
That seems to be where everybody else ends up these days

But I will wait for you
As long as I need to
And if you ever get back to Hackensack
I'll be here for you

And I will wait for you
As long as I need to
And if you ever get back to Hackensack
I'll be here for you
If you ever get back to Hackensack
I'll be here for you







My fire through cold nights
The brightest of all lights
You are my home
Wherever we go

We don't need a thing under the tree
You're giving me all I need

Every day is a holiday
When you're the reason to celebrate
Every day is a holiday
When you're the reason
Every day is a holiday
When you're the reason to celebrate
Every day is a holiday
When you're the reason, you are the reason

My heart can't stop singing
You can't fight this feeling
Unspeakable joy
Ringing through my soul

We don't need a thing under the tree
You're giving me all I need

Every day is a holiday
When you're the reason to celebrate
Every day is a holiday
When you're the reason
Every day is a holiday
When you're the reason to celebrate
Every day is a holiday
When you're the reason, you are the reason

We don't need a thing under the tree
Cause you give me all I need

Every day is a holiday
When you're the reason to celebrate
Every day is a holiday
When you're the reason, when you're the reason
Every day is a holiday
When you're the reason to celebrate
Every day is a holiday
When you're the reason






[Kanye West - Verse 1]
I got a dirty mind
I got filthy ways
I'm tryna bathe my ape, (ape),
In your milky way (way)
I'm a legend
I'm irreverent
I be reverend
I'll be so faaaaa-ar up
We don't give a fuuuh-uh-uck
Welcome to the danger zone
Step into the fantasy
You are not invited to the other side of sanity
They're callin' me an alien a big headed astronaut
Maybe it's because your boy Yeezy get ass a lot

[Katy Perry]
You're so hypnotizing
Could you be the devil?
Could you be an angel?
Your touch magnetizing
Feels like I am floating
Leaves my body glowing

They say, be afraid
You're not like the others
Futuristic lover
Different DNA
They don't understand you

[Bridge]
You're from a whole other world
A different dimension
You open my eyes
And I'm ready to go
Lead me into the light

[Chorus:]
Kiss me, kiss me
Infect me with your love and
Fill me with your poison
Take me, take me
Wanna be your victim
Ready for abduction
Boy, you're an alien
Your touch so foreign
It's supernatural
Extraterrestrial

You're so supersonic
Wanna feel your powers
Stun me with your laser
Your kiss is cosmic
Every move is magic

You're from a whole other world
A different dimension
You open my eyes
And I'm ready to go
Lead me into the light

[Chorus:]
Kiss me, kiss me
Infect me with your love and
Fill me with your poison
Take me, take me
Wanna be a victim
Ready for abduction
Boy, you're an alien
Your touch so foreign
It's supernatural
Extraterrestrial

[Kanye West - Verse 2]
I know a bar out in Mars
Where they drivin' spaceships instead of cars
Cop a prada space suit about the stars
Getting stupid hah, straight up out the jars
Pockets on shrek, rockets on deck
Tell me what's next? Alien sex.
Imma disrobe you
Then Imma probe you
See I've abducted you
So I'll tell you what to do
I tell you what to do (what to do, what to do)

[Katy Perry]
Kiss me, kiss me
Infect me with your love and
Fill me with your poison
Take me, take me
Wanna be a victim
Ready for abduction
Boy, you're an alien
Your touch so foreign
It's supernatural
Extraterrestrial

Extraterrestrial
Extraterrestrial

Boy, you're an alien
Your touch so foreign
It's supernatural
Extraterrestrial






All along the western front 
People line up to receive. 
She got the power in her hand 
To shock you like you won't believe. 
Saw her in the amazon 
With the voltage running through her skin 
Standing there with nothing on 
She gonna teach me how to swim 

I said ooh girl 
Shock me like an electric eel 
Baby girl 
Turn me on with your electric feel 

I said ooh girl 
Shock me like an electric eel 
Baby girl 
Turn me on with your electric feel 

All along the eastern shore 
Put your circuits in the sea 
This is what the world is for 
Making electricity 
You can feel it in your mind 
Oh you can do it all the time 
Plug it in and change the world 
You are my electric girl. 

I said ooh girl 
Shock me like an electric eel 
Baby girl 
Turn me on with your electric feel

I've got people to see 
Places to go 
Deadlines to meet 
A reputation to up hold 
Its like a ton of bricks 
Breaking on my back 
Its like 
The force of gravity 
In full effect 

I got money to burn 
And I'm on the sake 
They bet their bomb on me 
Cause I'm their ace of spades 

I feel the walls 
Getting closer 
I'm like a bomb 
With all red wires 

All this pressure 
All this pressure 
Maybe it means 
I'm gonna be 
All this pressure 
All this pressure 
Maybe this means 
I'm gonna be 

A diamond 
It wont ever bend 
A diamond 
Cause there ladies 
Best friends a diamond 
But there 
There has to be more 
Than what these pirates 
Are gambling for 

If not for the push 
Id probably be a pebble 
If not for the pressure 
Id be forgotten forever 
Just another stone 
Skipped upon the water 
Drowning fast before 
The other failures 

I don't wanna be 
A distant memory 
On your wall 
Just another cd 
That you burned 
And never bought 
Am I not worth it to you? 
After all that drama 
That we've been though? 

All this pressure 
All this pressure 
Maybe it means 
I'm gonna be 
All this pressure 
All this pressure 
Maybe this means 
I'm gonna be 

A diamond 
It wont ever bend 
A diamond 
Cause there ladies 
Best friends 
A diamond 
But there 
There has to be more 
Than what these pirates 
Are gambling for 

Ooh oohh diamond 
I've gotta be a diamond 
(I'm a diamond in the sky 
With you standing by 
Now catch me if I fall) 
Ohhh ohhh ohhhh 
Yeah yeah yeah 

All this pressure 
All this pressure 
Oh, I've gotta be 
Oh, I've gotta be 
All this pressure 
All this pressure 
Oh, I've gotta be 
Oh, I've gotta be 

I'm a diamond in the sky 
With you standing by 
Now catch me if I fall 
Into the arms of a coma 

All this pressure 
I've got pressure 
I'm gonna be a diamond baby 
I've gotta be a diamond 
Your gonna see 
I'm gonna be a diamond







[Verse 1]
I knew you were
You were gonna come to me
And here you are,
But you better choose carefully
Cause I-I-I-I'm capable of anything
Of anything, and everything
Make me your Aphrodite
Make me your ONE & ONLY
But don't make me your enemy
Your enemy
Your enemy

[Hook]
So you wanna play with magic?
Boy, you should know what you're falling for
Baby, do you dare to do this?
Cause I'm coming at you like a DARK HORSE
Are you ready for? ready for?
A perfect storm? perfect storm?
'Cause once you're mine, once you're mine
There's no going back!! hey! Hey! Hey!

[Verse 2]
Mark my words
This love will make you levitate
Like a bird, like a bird without a cage
We're DOWN TO EARTH,
If you choose to walk away
Don't walk away.
It's in the palm of your hand now baby
It's a yes or a no?
No maybe, so just be sure
Before you give it up to me
Up to me, give it up to me

[Hook]
So you wanna play with magic?
Boy, you should know what you're falling for
Baby, do you dare to do this?
Cause I'm coming at you like a DARK HORSE

There's no going back!! hey! Hey! Hey!

[Pitbull]
I'm an outcast, I got THAT!
So the player list the Cadillac music,
and that's just a start
MY LIFE, I took it from the back to the front, Rosa park
Who cares what they blink or they bought
Who cares what they think or they thought
Baby, we can do it in the car
In the kitchen, on the floor
In the middle of the park - I'm here to play
With a little ding
I pump blood through your veins, your heart
And all these packs of lil players acting like they can hate
But they can not, 
CAN'T WON'T DON'T NEVER
WILL YOU KEEP REAL?
ONE, TWO, THREE
FOUR TIMES,
CYPRESS HILL
Hey Ms. Perry,
Looking fine with your fine self
Want a little bit of magic?

No worry about where I'm from, 
Just know one thing: I'M AMAZING!

Straight for you heart (yeah)

Well, why do you think they call me Jessie James?
Sweet as a peach, impossible to tame
Fingers on the trigger and you’ll be to blame

Straight for you heart (yeah)
Be careful what you start!

Straight for you heart (yeah)

And now I've met a man that breaks me

We woke up late, said goodbye
Now I'm standing outside on the street
I walk through the city, I'm laughing
In case staring down at my feet
If I look up, the sky might fall
Open up and pull me in
I feel like an angel who's fallen
But I just got to have the taste of original sin

Damn, can you feel it?
Damn I cant believe it
Damn you got me feeling good
Damn, do you dig it
That's the way you do it
Damn you know you give it good

Two minutes later, I'm counting
The seconds and hours to go
Working a sweat out of bed
Just the thought of you is making me glow
I got the fact that you get it good
Now back up and just leave it alone
I'm walking on air cuz your crunk
Now I'm going home to do it all again on my own

Damn, can you feel it?
Damn I cant believe it
Damn you got me feeling good
Damn, do you dig it
That's the way you do it
Damn you know you give it good

You got my tongue, its so tied
My eyes are open wide
And my hair is standing up on my skin
And I keep saying:

Damn, do you dig it
That's the way you do it
Damn you know you give it good

Walk through the door, and enter your room
Cuz this whole world lies but you tell the truth
Do you think I'm gonna give you up?
Your never gonna let me down
Your love is like an ocean and I'm starting to drown

Damn, can you feel it?
Damn I cant believe it
Damn you got me feeling good
Damn, do you dig it
That's the way you do it
Damn you know you give it good

You got my tongue, its so tied
My eyes are open wide
And my hair is standing up on my skin
And I keep saying:

Damn, do you dig it
That's the way you do it
Damn you know you give it good

Damn, I can't believe it, I cant believe it...
Ooh you got me feelin good good good







You are my hurt locker lover
Keep me walking on a wire
Don't know when you'll blow
So I tiptoe through your triggered mind
You fight me but I'm on your side
Defeated, now retreating

[Pre-chorus:]
Why you tryna make me your enemy
All you really need is a little peace
I just wanna be your lover
Oh, this is not a competition
So baby why the ammunition
I don't wanna be the last one standing

[Chorus:]
Choose your battles, babe
Then you'll win the war
Stop digging your own grave
When there's so much to live for
Choose your battles, babe
'Cause I'm not fighting anymore
I am not fighting anymore

I've tried to pick off your red flags
But dancing on broken glass
Your mind games hit like grenades
We're cursed just like the Kennedys
But you somehow get me on my knees,
Defeated, now retreating

[Pre-chorus]

[Chorus]

If you wanna go, then go
If you wanna stay, then stay
'Cause I don't wanna fight no more, baby
I am not fighting anymore

If you wanna go, then go
If you wanna stay, then stay
I don't wanna fight no more anyway,
I am not fighting anymore

If you wanna go, then go
(choose your battles, babe)
If you wanna stay, then stay
(then you win the war)
'Cause I don't wanna fight no more, baby
(Stop digging your own grave
When there's so much to live for)

Choose your battles, babe
'Cause I'm not fighting anymore
I am not fighting anymore anyway, anyway,
I am not fighting anymore

If you wanna go, then go
If you wanna stay, then stay
'Cause I don't wanna fight no more, baby








Is Mercury in retrograde?
Or is that the excuse that I've always made?
'Cause I wanna blame you,
But I can only blame myself

Yeah, it's easy to throw you under the bus
Or call you crazy, while filling my cup
I say these things to hurt you
But I only hurt myself
Oh, I can only take responsibility for me

It takes two, two sides to every story
Not just you
I can't keep ignoring
I admit half of it, I'm not that innocent, oh yeah

It takes two, two sides to every story
Not just me
You can't keep ignoring
But let me be first baby to say "I'm sorry", "I'm sorry"

I face my demons, yeah, I paid my dues
I had to grow up, I wish you could too
I wanted to save you, but I can only save myself

Oh, I can only be the change I want to see
Yeah, to see

It takes two, two sides to every story
Not just you
I can't keep ignoring
I admit half of it, I'm not that innocent, yeah ohh

It takes two, two sides to every story
Not just me
You can't keep ignoring
But let me be first baby to say "I'm sorry", "I'm sorry"

I point my finger but it does me no good
I look in the mirror and it tells me the truth, yeah
Why all these lessons always learned the hard way
Is it too late to change?

Ohh, It takes two, two sides to every story
Not just you
I can't keep ignoring
And I admit half of it, I'm not that innocent, oh

It takes two, two sides to every story
Not just me
You can't keep ignoring
But let me be first baby to say "I'm sorry", "I'm sorry", "I'm sorry"







I'm wide awake
I'm wide awake

I'm wide awake
Yeah, I was in the dark
I was falling hard
With an open heart
(I'm wide awake)
How did I read the stars so wrong?
(I'm wide awake)
And now it's clear to me
That everything you see
Ain't always what it seems
(I'm wide awake)
Yeah, I was dreaming for so long

[Pre-Chorus:]
I wish I knew then
What I know now
Wouldn't dive in
Wouldn't bow down
Gravity hurts
You made it so sweet
'Til I woke up on
On the concrete

[Chorus:]
Falling from cloud nine
Crashing from the high
I'm letting go tonight
Yeah, I'm falling from cloud nine

I'm wide awake
Not losing any sleep
I picked up every piece
And landed on my feet
I'm wide awake
Need nothing to complete myself, no

I'm wide awake
Yeah, I am born again
Out of the lion's den
I don't have to pretend
And it's too late
The story's over now, the end

[Pre-Chorus:]
I wish I knew then
What I know now
Wouldn't dive in
Wouldn't bow down
Gravity hurts
You made it so sweet
'Til I woke up on
On the concrete

[Chorus:]
Falling from cloud nine (it was out of the blue)
I'm crashing from the high
I'm letting go tonight (yeah, I'm letting you go)
I'm falling from cloud nine

(I'm wide awake)
Thunder rumbling
Castles crumbling
(I'm wide awake)
I am trying to hold on
(I'm wide awake)
God knows that I tried
Seeing the bright side
(I'm wide awake)
I'm not blind anymore...

I'm wide awake
I'm wide awake

[Chorus:]
Yeah, I'm falling from cloud nine (it was out of the blue)
Crashing from the high
You know I'm letting go tonight (yeah, I'm letting you go)
I'm falling from cloud nine

I'm wide awake
I'm wide awake
I'm wide awake
I'm wide awake
I'm wide awake






Lay me down at your altar, baby
I'm a slave to this love
Your electric lips have gotten me speaking in the tongues

I have prayed for a power like you
To see deep down in my soul
Oh, you make me bloom like a flower, a desert rose

Magical one and mystery
All of your charms have worked on me
I will surrender myself
Holding hell and heaven high
You have opened up my eyes
And I am finally healed

This is spiritual, under your spell
Phenomenal, the way you make me feel
Like an angel, all a glow
Like a feather, you make me float

Flying high as a kite on your love
Lost in sweet ecstasy
Found a nirvana finally

Magical one and mystery
All of your charms have worked on me
I will surrender myself
Holding hell and heaven high
You have opened up my eyes
And I am finally here

This is spiritual, under your spell
Phenomenal, the way you make me feel
Like an angel, all a glow
Like a feather, you make me float

(You make me float, you make me float)

This is spiritual, under your spell
So phenomenal, the way you make me feel
Like an angel, all a glow
Like a feather, you make me float

(You make me float, oh, you make me float)







Days like this I want to drive away
Pack my bags and watch your shadow fade
[Standard version:] 'Cause you chewed me up and spit me out
["Complete Confection" version:] You chewed me up and spit me out
Like I was poison in your mouth
You took my light, you drained me down
But that was then and this is now
Now look at me

[Chorus:]
This is the part of me
That you’re never gonna ever take away from me, no
This is the part of me
That you’re never gonna ever take away from me, no
Throw your sticks and your stones,
Throw your bombs and your blows
But you’re not gonna break my soul
This is the part of me
That you’re never gonna ever take away from me, no

I just wanna throw my phone away
Find out who is really there for me
[Standard version:] 'Cause you ripped me off, your love was cheap
["Complete Confection" version:] You ripped me off, your love was cheap
Was always tearing at the seams
[Standard version:] I fell deep, and you let me down
["Complete Confection" version:] I fell deep, you let me down
But that was then and this is now
Now look at me

[Chorus]

Now look at me I’m sparkling
A firework, a dancing flame
You won't ever put me out again
I’m glowin’, oh, whoa
[Standard version:] You can keep the dog from me
["Complete Confection" version:] So you can keep the diamond ring
[Standard version:] I never liked it anyway
["Complete Confection" version:] It don't mean nothing anyway
In fact you can keep everything, yeah, yeah,
Except for me

[Chorus]

[Standard ending:]
This is the part of me
That you’re never gonna ever take away from me, no
This is the part of me
That you’re never gonna ever take away from me, no
Throw your sticks and your stones,
Throw your bombs and your blows
But you’re not gonna break my soul
This is the part of me
That you’re never gonna ever take away from me, no

["Complete Confection" ending:]
This is the part of me, no
Away from me, no
This is the part of me, me, me, me, me, me, me, me..., no
Throw your sticks and your stones,
Throw your bombs and your blows
But you’re not gonna break my soul
This is the part of me
That you’re never gonna ever take away from me, no







(Dressin' up, dressin' up for you, for you, for you)
(Dressin' up, dressin' up for you, for you)

Saucer of milk
Table for two
You wanna pet my kitty?
You such a dirty doggy
It's your lucky night 'cause I'm in the mood
I'm feeling spicy
I'm feeling real naughty

Pick a part, you dream it up
A dark vixen, a Lolita
Oh boy, tell me your fantasy
Tonight's the night
I'm dressing up for you

I can tell you're obsessed by your shortness of breath
Ooh, my cookie monster wants a taste test
Be a good boy and I'll show you the rest
Ooh, my little voyeur wants to play explorer

Pick a part, you dream it up
Librarian, dominatrix
Oh boy, tell me your fantasy
Tonight's the night (tonight's the night)

[Chorus:]
Tonight, I'm gonna come alive
Make you forget about your nine to five
Are you ready for your blood to rise?
Tonight's the night
I'm dressing up for you

(Dressin' up)

You're getting hot
So let's call the nurse
Ooh, I feel a fever
Let's take your temperature
Better behave
Or a police officer will have to hold you down,
Give you what you deserve

Pick a part,
You dream it up
Use your imagination
Oh boy, I'll be your fantasy
Tonight's the night (tonight's the night)

[Chorus 2x]

Tied, tight, tip, teasing
Push, pull, pressure, pleasing
Beads of sweat drip down your neck,
Breathing deep, gaining speed, about to peak
Trembling, trembling, trembling

[Chorus 2x]

I'm dressin' up
I'm dressin' up for you
I'm dressin' up [5x]
For you
I'm dressin' up
I'm dressin' up for you






I lost myself in fear of losing you
I wish I didn't do
But I did
I lost my own, my own identity
Forgot that you picked me for me

But now, I don't negotiate with insecurities
They always seem to get the best of me
I found I had to love myself, the way I wanted you to...

...love me,
No more second guessing
No, there’s no more questioning
I’ll be the one defining who I'm gonna be
No concealing feelings, or changing seasonally
I’m gonna love myself, the way I want you to love me

Sometimes I wish my skin was a costume
That I could just unzip
And strip
But who I am is who I'm meant to be
And it's who you are in love, in love with

So now, I don't negotiate with insecurities
They're gonna have to take a back seat
I know I have to love myself, the way I want you to...

...love me,
No more second guessing
No, there’s no more questioning
I’ll be the one defining who I'm gonna be
No concealing feelings, or changing seasonally
I’m gonna love myself, the way I want you to love me

[2x]
No more standing in my own way
Let's go deeper, let's get closer
No more standing in my own way
(I want you to love me)

No more second guessing
No, there’s no more questioning
I’ll be the one defining who I'm gonna be
No concealing my feelings, or changing seasonally
I’m gonna love myself, the way I want you to love me

No more second guessing
No, there’s no more questioning
I’ll be the one defining who I'm gonna be
No concealing feelings, or changing seasonally
I’m gonna love myself, the way I want you to love me







Was 27, surviving my return of Saturn
A long vacation didn't sound so bad
Was full of secrets, locked up tight like Iron Mountain
Running on empty, so out of gas

Thought I wasn't enough
Found I wasn't so tough
Laying on the bathroom floor
We were living on a fault line
And I felt the fault was all mine
Couldn't take it anymore

[Chorus:]
By the grace of God
There was no other way
I picked myself back up
I knew I had to stay
I put one foot in front of the other
And I looked in the mirror
And decided to stay
Wasn't gonna let love take me out that way

I thank my sister for keeping my head above the water
When the truth was like swallowing sand
Now every morning, there is no more mourning
Oh I can finally see myself again

I know I am enough
Possible to be loved
It was not about me
Now I have to rise above
Let the Universe call the bluff
Yeah, the truth will set you free

[Chorus]

That way, no
That way, no
Not in the name of love (In the name of love)
That way, no
That way, no
I am not giving up

By the grace of God
I picked myself back up
I put one foot in front of the other
And I looked in the mirror

[Chorus]






Can you tell me, who called a race?
Can anyone stay in one place?
And when you get to the finish line
Will you wish for more time?
But see, one day
One day you will
But maybe one day you will find
That you just can't push rewind

All we have is this moment
Tomorrow's unspoken
Yesterday is history
So why don't you be here with me?
All we have is this moment
To put a love into motion
Yesterday is history
So why don't you be here with me?
Be here with me now

Do you ever think that we're just chasing our tails?
Like life is one big fast treadmill
And we pop what is prescribed
If it gets us first prize
But you know who I, who I think will win
Are the ones that let love in
Are the ones that take the time

All we have is this moment
Tomorrow's unspoken
Yesterday is history
So why don't you be here with me?
All we have is this moment
To put a love into motion
Yesterday is history
So why don't you be here with me?
Be here with me now

Be here with me now
'Cause the future is right now, right in front of you
Don't let the clock, the clock tell you what to do
Our future is right now, I'm in front of you
Baby don't blink and miss

This moment
Tomorrow's unspoken
Yesterday is history
So why don't you be here with me?
All we have is this moment
To put a love into motion
Yesterday is history
So why don't you be here with me?
Be here with me now







You're a one of a one
A one of a kind
That you only find once in a lifetime
Made to fit like a fingerprint
A code that clicks open a gold mine

They say one man's trash is another man's treasure
When I found you, it was all pitter-patter

Secretly, I hit the lottery
'Cause you're brighter than all of the Northern Lights
You speak to me, even in my dreams
Wouldn't let you go for even the highest price

They say one man's trash is another girl's treasure
So if it's up to me, I'm gonna keep you forever

'Cause I understand you, we see eye to eye
Like a double rainbow in the sky
And wherever you go, so will I
'Cause a double rainbow is hard to find

Was a phenomenon when you came along
Yeah, our chemistry was more than science
It was deafening, loud like lightning, it was striking
You couldn't deny it

They say one man's trash is another man's treasure
The two of us together, make everything glitter

'Cause I understand you, we see eye to eye
Like a double rainbow in the sky
And wherever you go, so will I
'Cause a double rainbow is hard to find

To the bottom of the sea, I'd go to find you
Climb the highest peak to be right beside you
Every step I take, I'm keeping you in mind

'Cause I understand you, we see eye to eye
Like a double rainbow in the sky
And wherever you go, so will I
'Cause a double rainbow is hard to find

It's hard to find,
It's hard to find
Once in a lifetime
Once in a lifetime
Once in a lifetime





[Missy Elliot]
Hey yo Katy
Let’s hit em with the remix baby
Let’s go…

It’s a Friday night now here we go
I ain’t no stripper but I work the pole
Bartender can you pour some more
And I’m so tipsy coming out my clothes
Fly high high high
And I can’t see so I can’t drive
I party till I’m out my mind
I kiss on him but he don’t mind
Then I wake up in the morn
I got a guy in my bed like hello good morn
Don’t remember how I got him home
But Friday night it was nice and long

[Katy Perry]
Last Friday night
Yeah we danced on table tops
And we took too many shots
Think we kissed but I forgot

Last Friday night
Yeah we maxed our credit cards
And got kicked out of the bar
So we hit the boulevard

Last Friday night
We went streaking in the park
Skinny dipping in the dark
Then had a menage a trois

Last Friday night
Yeah I think we broke the law
Always say we’re gonna stop-op
Oh whoa oh

This Friday night
Do it all again
This Friday night
Do it all again

Trying to connect the dots
Don’t know what to tell my boss
Think the city towed my car
Chandelier is on the floor
With my favorite party dress
Warrants out for my arrest
Think I need a ginger ale
That was such an epic fail

Pictures of last night
Ended up online
I’m screwed
Oh well
It’s a blacked out blur
But I’m pretty sure it ruled
Damn

Last Friday night
Yeah we danced on table tops
And we took too many shots
Think we kissed but I forgot

Last Friday night
Yeah we maxed our credits card
And got kicked out of the bars
So we hit the boulevards

Last Friday night
We went streaking in the park
Skinny dipping in the dark
Then had a menage a trois

Last Friday night
Yeah I think we broke the law
Always say we’re gonna stop-op
Oh whoa oh

This Friday night
Do it all again
(Do it all again)
This Friday night
Do it all again
(Do it all again)
This Friday night

T.G.I.F.
T.G.I.F.

Let’s do this shit like every weekend

T.G.I.F.
T.G.I.F.
T.G.I.F.

Now pour my drink till there ain’t nothing left.

T.G.I.F.
T.G.I.F.
T.G.I.F.

Last Friday night
Yeah we danced on table tops
And we took too many shots
Think we kissed but I forgot

Last Friday night
Yeah we maxed our credit cards
And got kicked out of the bar
So we hit the boulevard

Last Friday night
We went streaking in the park
Skinny dipping in the dark
Then had a menage a trois

Last Friday night
Yeah I think we broke the law
Always say we’re gonna stop-op
Oh-whoa-oh

This Friday night
Do it all again





Oh, no.

[Juicy J:]
Yeah
Ya'll know what it is
Katy Perry
Juicy J, aha.
Let's rage

[Katy Perry:]
I knew you were
You were gonna come to me
And here you are
But you better choose carefully
‘Cause I, I’m capable of anything
Of anything and everything

Make me your Aphrodite
Make me your one and only
But don’t make me your enemy, your enemy, your enemy

So you wanna play with magic
Boy, you should know what you're falling for
Baby do you dare to do this?
Cause I’m coming at you like a dark horse
Are you ready for, ready for
A perfect storm, perfect storm
Cause once you’re mine, once you’re mine
There’s no going back

Mark my words
This love will make you levitate
Like a bird
Like a bird without a cage
But down to earth
If you choose to walk away, don’t walk away

It’s in the palm of your hand now baby
It’s a yes or no, no maybe
So just be sure before you give it all to me
All to me, give it all to me

So you wanna play with magic
Boy, you should know what you're falling for
Baby do you dare to do this?
Cause I’m coming at you like a dark horse
Are you ready for, ready for
A perfect storm, perfect storm
Cause once you’re mine, once you’re mine (love trippin')
There’s no going back

[Juicy J - Rap Verse:]
Uh
She’s a beast
I call her Karma (come back)
She eats your heart out
Like Jeffrey Dahmer (woo)
Be careful
Try not to lead her on
Shorty’s heart is on steroids
Cause her love is so strong
You may fall in love
When you meet her
If you get the chance you better keep her
She's sweet as pie but if you break her heart
She'll turn cold as a freezer
That fairy tale ending with a knight in shining armor
She can be my Sleeping Beauty
I’m gon’ put her in a coma
Woo!
Damn I think I love her
Shorty so bad, I’m sprung and I don’t care
She ride me like a roller coaster
Turned the bedroom into a fair (a fair!)
Her love is like a drug
I was tryna hit it and quit it
But lil' mama so dope
I messed around and got addicted

[Katy Perry:]
So you wanna play with magic
Boy, you should know what you're falling for (you should know)
Baby do you dare to do this?
Cause I’m coming at you like a dark horse (like a dark horse)
Are you ready for, ready for (ready for)
A perfect storm, perfect storm (a perfect storm)
Cause once you’re mine, once you’re mine (mine)
There’s no going back






You sent a text
It's like the wind changed your mind
We were best friends
Yeah, we were building our life

With every kiss, and every letter
Every promise of forever, oh
But you hit "Send"
And disappeared in front of my eyes

And now you’re just a ghost
When I look back never would have known that
You could be so cold
Like a stranger vanish like a vapor
There's just an echo where your heart used to be
Now I see it clearly
And there's just a pillow where your head used to sleep
My vision's 20/20
I see through you now

Something has died
Now that I have made up my mind
I'll be alright
It doesn't haunt me at night

'Cause every gift, and every letter,
Every promise of forever
Now, it's out of sight
Like you were never alive

And now you’re just a ghost
When I look back never would have known that
You could be so cold
Like a stranger vanish like a vapor
There's just an echo where your heart used to be
Now I see it clearly
And there's just a pillow where your head used to sleep
My vision's 20/20
I see through you now

Now, now, now, now, now
Now, now, now, now, now

So rest in peace
I'll see you on the other side

And now you’re just a ghost
When I look back never would have known that
You could be so cold
Like a stranger vanish like a vapor
There's just an echo where your heart used to be
Now I see it clearly
And there's just a pillow where your head used to sleep
My vision's 20/20
I see through you now

Now, now, now, now

I see through you now

Now, now, now, now

I see through you now

Oh no, did I get too close?
Oh, did I almost see what's really on the inside?
All your insecurities
All the dirty laundry
Never made me blink one time

Unconditional, unconditionally
I will love you unconditionally
There is no fear now
Let go and just be free
I will love you unconditionally

Come just as you are to me
Don't need apologies
Know that you are worthy
I'll take your bad days with your good
Walk through the storm I would
I do it all because I love you, I love you

Unconditional, unconditionally
I will love you unconditionally
There is no fear now
Let go and just be free
I will love you unconditionally

So open up your heart and just let it begin
Open up your heart and just let it begin
Open up your heart and just let it begin
Open up your heart

Acceptance is the key to be
To be truly free
Will you do the same for me?

Unconditional, unconditionally
I will love you unconditionally
And there is no fear now
Let go and just be free
'Cause I will love you unconditionally (oh yeah)
I will love you (unconditionally)
I will love you
I will love you unconditionally





I used to bite my tongue and hold my breath
Scared to rock the boat and make a mess
So I sit quietly, agree politely
I guess that I forgot I had a choice
I let you push me past the breaking point
I stood for nothing, so I fell for everything

[Pre-Chorus:]
You held me down, but I got up (HEY!)
Already brushing off the dust
You hear my voice, you hear that sound
Like thunder gonna shake the ground
You held me down, but I got up (HEY!)
Get ready 'cause I've had enough
I see it all, I see it now

[Chorus:]
I got the eye of the tiger, a fighter, dancing through the fire
'Cause I am a champion and you're gonna hear me roar
Louder, louder than a lion
'Cause I am a champion and you're gonna hear me roar
Oh oh oh oh oh oh oh
Oh oh oh oh oh oh oh
Oh oh oh oh oh oh oh
You're gonna hear me roar

Now I'm floating like a butterfly
Stinging like a bee I earned my stripes
I went from zero, to my own hero

[Pre-Chorus:]
You held me down, but I got up (HEY!)
Already brushing off the dust
You hear my voice, you hear that sound
Like thunder gonna shake the ground
You held me down, but I got up (HEY!)
Get ready 'cause I've had enough
I see it all, I see it now

[Chorus:]
I got the eye of the tiger, a fighter, dancing through the fire
'Cause I am a champion and you're gonna hear me roar
Louder, louder than a lion
'Cause I am a champion and you're gonna hear me roar
Oh oh oh oh oh oh oh
Oh oh oh oh oh oh oh
Oh oh oh oh oh oh oh
(You're gonna hear me roar)
Oh oh oh oh oh oh oh
Oh oh oh oh oh oh oh
(You'll hear me roar)
Oh oh oh oh oh oh oh
You're gonna hear me roar...

Ro-oar, ro-oar, ro-oar, ro-oar, ro-oar

I got the eye of the tiger, a fighter, dancing through the fire
'Cause I am a champion and you're gonna hear me roar
Louder, louder than a lion
'Cause I am a champion and you're gonna hear me roar
Oh oh oh oh oh oh oh
Oh oh oh oh oh oh oh
Oh oh oh oh oh oh oh
(You're gonna hear me roar)
Oh oh oh oh oh oh oh
Oh oh oh oh oh oh oh
(You'll hear me roar)
Oh oh oh oh oh oh oh
You're gonna hear me roar...






Under a silver moon,
Tropical temperature
I feel my lotus bloom
Come closer
I want your energy,
I want your aura
You are my destiny,
My mantra

I never knew I could see something so clearly looking through my third eye
Never knew karma could be so rewarding and bring me to your light
Maybe this is the beginning of something so magical tonight (oh, oh, oh, oh, oh)

Take me down to the river
Underneath the blood-orange sun
Say my name like a scripture
Keep my heart beating like a drum

Legendary lovers, we could be legendary
La la la la la
Legendary lovers, we should be legendary
La la la la la

Go down in history
Go down together,
Into infinity,
Forever
Your Cleopatra
Your blushing Juliet
Anything for your love,
A ride or die

I never knew I could see something so clearly looking through my third eye
Never knew karma could be so rewarding and bring me to your light
Maybe this is the beginning of something so magical tonight (oh, oh, oh, oh, oh)

Take me down to the river
Underneath the blood-orange sun
Say my name like a scripture
Keep my heart beating like a drum

Legendary lovers, we could be legendary
La la la la la
Legendary lovers, we should be legendary
La la la la la

[Instrumental]

(Legendary lovers)
(Legendary lovers)
(Legendary lovers)

Oh, take me down to the river
Underneath the blood-orange sun
Say my name like a scripture
Keep my heart beating like a drum

Legendary lovers, we could be legendary (legendary)
La la la la la
Legendary lovers, we should be legendary (oh, take me down)
La la la la la

Take me down to the river
Underneath the blood-orange sun (underneath the sun)
Say my name like a scripture
Keep my heart beating like a drum (oh baby)

Legendary lovers, we could be legendary
La la la la la
Legendary lovers, we should be legendary
La la la la la





Tonight, tonight, tonight, I'm walking on air
Tonight, tonight, tonight, I'm walking on air

You're giving me sweet, sweet ecstasy
Yeah, you take me to utopia
You're reading me like erotica,
Boy, you make me feel exotic, yeah

Just when I think I can't take anymore
We go deeper and harder than ever before
We go higher and higher
I feel like I'm already there

I'm walking on air (tonight)
I'm walking on air
I'm walking, I'm walking on air (tonight)
I'm walking on air
I'm walking on air (tonight)
I'm walking on air
I'm walking, I'm walking on air (tonight)
I'm walking on air
I'm walking on air

This is pure paradise,
Even heaven is jealous of our love
Yes, we make angels cry,
Raining down on earth from up above

Just when I think I can't take anymore
We go deeper and harder than ever before
We go higher and higher
I feel like I'm already there

I'm walking on air (tonight)
I'm walking on air
I'm walking, I'm walking on air (tonight)
I'm walking on air
I'm walking on air (tonight)
I'm walking on air
I'm walking, I'm walking on air (tonight)
I'm walking on air
I'm walking on air

Tonight, tonight, tonight, I'm walking on air
Tonight, tonight, tonight, I'm walking on air

Heaven is jealous of our love
Angels are crying from up above

Tonight (tonight), I'm walking on air
I'm walking, I'm walking, I'm walking on air
Tonight (tonight), I'm walking on air
I'm walking on air
I'm walking on air
Tonight (tonight), I'm walking on air
I'm walking, I'm walking, I'm walking on air
Tonight (tonight), I'm walking on air
I'm walking on air

Tonight, tonight, tonight, I'm walking on air
I'm walking on air
Tonight, tonight, tonight, I'm walking on air
I'm walking on air




 Greetings loved ones
Let's take a journey

California girls

Let's go all the way tonight
No regrets, just love
We can dance, until we die
You and I, will be young forever

You make me feel
Like I'm livin' a
Teenage dream
The way you turn me on
I can't sleep
Let's run away and
Don't ever look back,
Don't ever look back

My heart stops
When you look at me
Just one touch
Now baby I believe
This is real
So take a chance and
Don't ever look back,
Don't ever look back

I'm a get your heart racing
In my skin-tight jeans
Be your teenage dream tonight
Let you put your hands on me
In my skin-tight jeans
Be your teenage dream tonight

I know a place
Where the grass is really greener
Warm, wet and wild
There must be something in the water

You could travel the world
But nothing comes close
To the golden coast
Once you party with us
You'll be falling in love
Oooooh Oh Oooooh

California girls
We're unforgettable
Daisy Dukes
Bikinis on top
Sun-kissed skin
So hot
We'll melt your popsicle
Oooooh Oh Oooooh

California girls
We're undeniable
Fine, fresh, fierce
We got it on lock
West coast represent
Now put your hands up
Oooooh Oh Oooooh

In another life
I would be your girl
We'd keep all our promises
Be us against the world

In another life
I would make you stay
So I don't have to say
You were the one that got away
The one that got away
The o-o-o-o-o-one [x3]

In another life
I would make you stay
So I don't have to say
You were the one that got away

There's a stranger in my bed,
There's a pounding in my head
Glitter all over the room
Pink flamingos in the pool
I smell like a minibar
DJ's passed out in the yard
Barbie's on the barbeque
This a hickie or a bruise

Pictures of last night
Ended up online
I'm screwed
Oh well
It's a blacked out blur
But I'm pretty sure it ruled
Damn

Last Friday night
Yeah, we danced on tabletops
And we took too many shots
Think we kissed but I forgot

Last Friday night
Yeah, we maxed our credit cards
And got kicked out of the bar
So we hit the boulevard

Last Friday night
We went streaking in the park
Skinny dipping in the dark
Then had a ménage à trois
Last Friday night
Yeah I think we broke the law
Always say we're gonna stop
Op-oh-oh

This Friday night
Do it all again

T.G.I.F.
T.G.I.F.
T.G.I.F.
T.G.I.F.
T.G.I.F.
T.G.I.F.

You're so hypnotizing
Could you be the devil?
Could you be an angel?

Your touch magnetizing
Feels like I am floating
Leaves my body glowing

They say, be afraid
You're not like the others
Futuristic lover
Different DNA
They don't understand you

You're from a whole 'nother world
A different dimension
You open my eyes
And I'm ready to go
Lead me into the light

Kiss me, kiss me
Infect me with your love and
Fill me with your poison

Take me, take me
Wanna be a victim
Ready for abduction

Boy, you're an alien
Your touch so foreign
It's supernatural
Extraterrestrial

Do you ever feel like a plastic bag,
Drifting through the wind
Wanting to start again?
Do you ever feel, feel so paper thin
Like a house of cards,
One blow from caving in?

Do you ever feel already buried deep?
6 feet under screams but no one seems to hear a thing
Do you know that there's still a chance for you
'Cause there's a spark in you

You just gotta ignite the light, and let it shine
Just own the night like the 4th of July

'Cause baby you're a firework
Come on, show 'em what you're worth
Make 'em go "Oh, oh, oh"
As you shoot across the sky-y-y

Boom, boom, boom
Even brighter than the moon, moon, moon
Boom, boom, boom
Even brighter than the moon, moon, moon.
